Chapter Number,Chapter NamePART1
Chapter 71,“Count One”,"ーーWith his final words washed away by the wind, Natsuki Subaru’s consciousness came to an end.
“ーーーー”
Speaking of irony, ironically enough, his『Death』this time had been a『Death』by his own volition.
Perhaps that is why his mind and heart had remained calm at the moment of『Death』ーー of course, that had not been the case, he had possessed uneasiness and nervousness for jumping into the circumstance of『Death』on his own accord.
However, unlike till now, he had faced the『Death』he had anticipated with much more sincerity than his other『Deaths』up to this time.
Of course, he did not believe that him choosing to die had truly saved Shaula.
She did not want to kill him, so she wanted him to command her to die.
Shaula, who had been concerned about Subaru to that extent, had let Subaru throw himself to his death right in front of her eyes. The weight of that impact he did not know and it must have​ immensely shattered her heart, which had continued awaiting for four hundred years.
That is why, this was nothing more than Subaru’s self-satisfaction. The worst kind of self-satisfaction of exaggerating and not seeing the result for himself with his own eyes.
Howeverーー,
Subaru: “ーーSo what.”
If all that is fastened to him was nothing but self-satisfaction, nothing but hypocrisy, what was wrong with that.
In the end, the method to catch and halt the impact of all happenings in this world could only be wielded in one’s own weighing scales. Unaccomplished good deeds hold no meaning, and the word known as hypocrisy doesn’t ultimately exist.
ーーAll of them, surviving.
After his discussion with Shaula, Subaru cemented the final objective he had touted.
ーーNo, to be precise, the survival of all of them had been his goal from the beginning. That judgement had merely decided whether to include Shaula in that or not, and Subaru chose to love all of them.
He shall lead the way to solve all of the catastrophes surrounding this sand tower.
For that purpose, he would do anything he could.
That isーー,
Subaru: “The meaning, behind why I am myself. ーーIsn’t that so, 『Natsuki Subaru』.”
Along with that instantaneous decision, he awakened from the deep, deep abyss of『Death』ーー.

"
Chapter 72,“■■・■”,"ーーUpon the advent of unforeseen『Death』, Natsuki Subaru heard the sound of ■ cracking.
However, upon each instance of that inexorable sound, he thought.
That it was certainly the proof of his progress not having come to a halt. That it was, the footsteps of the approaching future.
No matter how small those steps were, no matter how trifling the path he had advanced upon was, he was certainly, walking and progressing.
???: “ーーSubaru.”
“ーーーー”
The moment his consciousness was led to awakening, blue eyes of a characteristic pattern were reflected into his own. In front of his eyes, peeping at Subaru worriedly was Beatrice.
Beatrice’s hand was gently placed at Subaru’s cheek, and Subaru inhaled.
He had parted with Beatrice’s crying face not too long ago.
That consciousness’ switchover had not been carried out well. Just previously, though it could not be associated with something as extravagant as a parting, she certainly had been in Subaru’s eyes.
Subaru: “……Ah.”
Beatrice: “Is your consciousness firm, I suppose? It took time for you to wake up till now, it was worrying, in fact. It would be better to confirm you did not lose any memories accidentally, I suppose. To start with, Betty, do you recall who……”
Subaru: “Bea, trice……”
Beatrice: “ーー. It seems you do properly remember, in fact. Good boy good boy, I suppose.”
Saying that, Beatrice stretched the hand she had at Subaru’s cheek towards his head. At the same pace, she patted him with her tiny palm and slowly​, his consciousness caught up to reality.
Subaru: “Count, one huh……”
“ーー?”
Beatrice tilted her head upon the whispering voice.
However, neither did she know what it meant, nor did he intend to explain it. She might not understand even if he were to explain, and he did not intend to make her understand either.
She was kind. Beatrice, was extremely kind.
That is why, what Subaru​ was testing out. If he were to tell her about that, it was a given that she would be absolutely against it. ーーThat was, something which Beatrice must not be allowed to know.
Beatrice: “So, how did it go, in fact? Was the purpose of reading the book fulfilled, I suppose?”
Subaru: “ーーYeah, about that.”
That is what Beatrice asked Subaru, who still had the book placed on his knees.
The moment immediately before the immediately previous momentーー the moment immediately before Subaru had disregarded his own physical state, Subaru had just been seeking a way to capture『Reid Astrea』and was just about to read his『Book of the Dead』.
That had come to a standstill due to complicated reasons, and multitudes of situations got caught in between the interval such that that would feel as if it was quite an old topicーー though that went only for Subaru, at maximum.
Things he ought to do, things he must do, they had all been decided.
That is whyーー,
Subaru: “Beatrice, it’ll be getting​ a bit confusing. ーーLend me, your strength.”
Beatrice: “ーー. That is a given, in fact. Betty is Subaru’s partner, I suppose.”
Promised Beatrice to Subaru, who had broken the ice without any explanations.
Her existence was, truly, very truly, reassuring for the ■.

△▼△▼△▼△

ーーThe impact, jumped around freely in the aisle of the stone tower.
???: “Haha ~tsu! Hahaha ~tsu! You’re doing it, you’re quite doing it, you’re surely doing it, perhaps you’re doing it, you’ve been doing it, you’ve done it, because you’ve been doing it ~tsu! Gluttonous drinking ~tsu! Gluttony ~tsu!”
???: “Is there any time to be playing around? That is quite the pliability, isn’t it.”
Using the walls, ceilings of the aisle as a foothold, making free use of transforming tactics at will from next to next was the Sin Archbishop of『Gluttony』, Ley Batenkaitos.
And the one rushing around at high speeds, having kept the inferior physical form of her body someplace else and moving around nimbly,was Ram.
Her petite frame fluttered about and danced, and directed merciless blows towards the direction of『Gluttony’s』body, who countered with equivalent fiendishness. At that point, rushing in as having been waiting for that wasーー,
Emilia: “ーーWroom and, boom!”
Wielding a large ice hammer in both of those hands, swinging it as if aiming for a home run was Emilia.
The damaging portion of the ice hammer, as large as a human’s trunk, turned into a strike with all of her might and made a firm hit onto Ley’s back. The small frame bounced and jumped along with a thunderous roar like a gum ball.
ーーNo, he bounced too far off.
Instantly kicking the ice hammer, he by himself had jumped ahead and killed the impact.
Ley: “Ahawaha~! You’re doing it doing it doing i~t! But but, that won’t do! That can’t defeat us!”
Emilia: “ーー~hk, he’s fast!”
In response to『Gluttony』displaying moves with a touch of acrobatics, Emilia made a frustrated expression on her cute face.
Past and present, east and west, chewing the experts of all kinds of master arts, demonstrating abilities that had, quite literally, become “every single kind of martial arts” was the Sin Archbishop of『Gluttony』, Ley’s fighting strengthーー or perhaps, it should be called his opposing pressure. It had attained preeminence, a remarkable difference of unleashing optimal techniques of the highest peak each moment to the next.
Subaru: “If the『Memories』, the efforts or the training, if they’re all being completely included then……”
Though it was quite hateful, perhaps『Gluttony』did not even have a need to possess a consciousness​ such as one saying “let’s pull them out”. When noticed the body already moved, that was the kind of Authority it was, of pulling them out in all kinds of scenes.
ーーThe stolen『Memories』even included the experience points of the physical body.
That was also evident by Subaru not remembering how to use the whip he carried around whatsoever. It seemed that the whip had been Subaru’s main weapon before losing his memories, but the correct way to hold it and swing it, he could remember none of it altogether.
In the first place, why did he choose something like a whip as his main weapon.
It’d be easier to make better use out of than a sword or a lance, it must have been a shallow thought like that. Though there were no objections to that itselfーー,
Subaru: “I wish I would’ve thought of a counter plan, in case I lost my memories……!”
Of course, he was aware it was an absurd request, however, Subaru still cursed it. By doing that, for a single moment, he was able to forget his effeminate jealousy towards his disappeared『Memories』.
The jealousy towards the disappeared『Memories』=『Natsuki Subaru』.
Beatrice: “Subaru, asking again, in fact. Are you really alright, I suppose?”
Towards that sideward face of Subaru’s, Beatrice raised her voice.
Upon her question, who had been supporting Subaru’s body as he shrugged his shoulders, Subaru nodded with a “Yeah”,
Subaru: “Right now, the fight’s a struggle…… if that collapses, our way to victory will……”
Beatrice: “ーーBut, there is opposition in Subaru being taken away from here, in fact.”
Subaru: “But, it’s necessary. You understand, right, Beatrice……”
Beatrice: “That isーー”
Subaru: “Lend me, your strength. Once again…… I request you.”
While maintaining meticulous caution among the ceaseless shocks, trying not to have his voice tremble, Subaru blackmailed Beatrice with an unfair manner of speaking.
In response to those cruel words of request of Subaru’s, Beatrice closed her eyes, making a strained expression.
Lend your strength, that was the flow of conversation they had also had in『Taygeta』 library.
However, that time had been before Subaru had activated『Cor Leonis』, and neither had Beatrice known that the situation of Pleiades Watchtower had deteriorated this much.
That is why, this was a heinous technique of Subaru’s which gripped onto Beatrice’s kindness.
“ーーーー”
Beatrice scrutinized Subaru’s proposal with a difficult face.
The sudden deterioration of Subaru’s physical condition and the recovery of Ram’s fighting strength which accompanied itーー the associativity between them was evident, and Ram, Beatrice, and even Emilia had noticed Subaru’s rash perseverance.
But still, everyone knew they could not tell him to stop.
ーーFor Subaru being burdened with his hardship was why the war front was being barely maintained.
Talk in name only, if Subaru was to unfasten『Cor Leonis』here whilst caring for himself, the first to follow would be the collapse of Ram, Emilia will get her『Name』eaten by『Gluttony』, their cooperation will crumble down and they will be defeated.
And should『Gluttony』be rendered free, the power balance of the tower would fall into an unrecoverable state, ultimately everyone would die in defeat and it would be game over.
Subaru: “……In the end, me being burdened is the best, the better option.”
Subaru, who could never really be of any help even when he was acting rash, was making strides in the fighting strength by taking over Ram’s inferior physical form. That was, an absolute requirement for capturing the tower.
Correctly speaking, even in the efficacy of『Cor Leonis』, there lay a trap not easy to solve.
That was, consciously or subconsciously, Ram saving up a bit of her fighting strength.
“ーーーー”
With overwhelming sense and techniques beyond comprehension, Ram maintained a firm balance in the place.
In spite of that, the reason why she had not gone further in order to overcome the opposition was because Ram had imposed a limiter on her own fighting strength. ーーThe reason for that was her faltering due to carefully considering Subaru’s status.
If Ram were to move to the fullest, it would impose an enormous burden onto Subaru.
Subaru would not be able to endure that. That possibility, was putting a halt on Ram’s limbs.
The truth is, something similar had occurred when he had gone around towards Julius and Reid.
It had been confirmed he was capable of taking over Ram’s inferior physical form through『Cor Leonis』itself without having to meet up with herーー however, in a situation where Ram does not know of the interrelation between her own favourable state and Subaru’s state, Ram does not save on her fighting strength.
As a result, the backfire, lacking any regret, scorched only Subaru and did not lead to mutual harm.
It also meant the end for Ram’s time as standing unrivalled, the worst kind of mutual harm.
It was not possible to continue sprinting with the entire strength for long in a state of lacking oxygen. That was all there was to it.
Henceforth, drawing up Ram’s fighting strength through『Cor Leonis』, in terms of results, Ram’s judgement to save onto her abilities was correct. Being balanced was the best.
However, that improvement of Ram’s combat power,『Gluttony』was indeed following and keeping up with it with the limitless arts of war he had plundered. Emilia was compensating for the parts where he could not be pushed away, but still,『Gluttony』could not be distanced away from, continuing to eat away with an extraordinary ability to survive.
That is why, towards thatーー,
Beatrice: “ーーMinya!!”
Enough to envelop the entire aisle, violet crystals materialised and were fired in a single action.
Acting in consent with Beatrice’s chant, who swung her small arm downwards, the concentrated attack of the magic called shadow magic swooped down onto Ley, who had turned his back towards this side, with tremendous vigour.
Immediately afterwards the boisterous dance of violet light swallowed the petite frame, engulfing the aisle with the sound of shattering glass.
“ーーーー”
Within the fluttering flakes of violet, dancing and falling, leaping away from the attack’s span were the two of Emilia and Ram. Evading the fire with instantaneous judgement, it was as expected of their physical ability to quickly avoid it.
On the other hand, having been in the same circumstance but only having delayed the part of him facing it with his back, Ley could not evade it easily the way Emilia and Ram had done.
It was a magic to be feared which crystallised the struck targets, turning them into a brittle and transient existence and smashing them.
Minya, capable of fatally wounding even through light contact, if it were to be recklessly fired this much in such a confined range it would be difficult for an enemy, even if it were to be a transient being, to cut through unhurt.
When the dance of the light which had been given rise to by the violet arrows came to a halt, the form of『Gluttony』who had taken enormous damage wasーー not there.
Beatrice: “ーー~hk!?”
Emilia: “Eh!? Where did……”
Beatrice inhaled in astonishment whilst Emilia made a strained expression and looked around.
Within the chaos, the one to get a grasp on the situation the fastest truly had been Ram.
She put her hand on her own right eye, and with only her left eye open, turned back. Subaru knew there was something like a path connecting him and Ram through『Cor Leonis』.
Ram, activated some type of a technique. Using that peculiar power, she understood where specifically the disappeared『Gluttony』 was.
His whereabouts wereーー,
Ram: “Barusu!”
“ーーーー”
Ram shouted, widening her light crimson eyes.
At that moment, from her line of sight Subaru comprehended the arrival of a hazardous presence right behind them. That was aiming for the back of Subaruーー no, Beatrice.
With the interruption by Minya just now, did it intend to convey that it had polluted the battle.
At any rate, it was not vastly different from the transpiring happening.
Ley: “ーーMust say, if the one right now was to be continued consecutively​, it’ll be getting tiresome, that’s why.”
Accompanying the sneering words, the dagger fastened to his arm flashed.
That was the strike by Ley, who had leapt through the space and escaped the concentrated attack of violet arrows. In line with the frequent usage of the『Fist King』, the odd talent of the one who became the『Leaper』ーー it could be named, short range warp.
According to what had been seen, it seemed as if there were certain limits to the distance, but still the compatibility of the strange talent of jumping over space and the encircling attack was the worst.
Carrying no significance regarding the type of the surprise attack, in the end, anything aside from getting involved in the head-on match wasーー,
Subaru: “Beatrice”
Beatrice: “Subaーー”
Thoughts and actions, ■ and body did not always coincide.
The moment initially​ after he pushed the small body away reflexively, a piercing sensation deeply gouged out his chest.
Subaru: “Kah.”
Like scratching the scab with claws, no, the pain and impact was several thousand times that. He instantly regretted having received that with his chest. Though he regretted it, no other convenient shield had been present there.
Bewildered by the momentary judgement, he shuddered at the mere thought of Beatrice having been slashing down. So much so that he thought it would be better for him to become a shield of flesh compared to that. It was painful, though it was painful, if it was merely pain, merely the wound on his body, it would last for only an instant. Not even an instant. But, it was much better than ■ being wounded.
Much better, than ■ dying.
“Subaruーー ~hk!!”
The loud voice echoed within the tower, when he tried to turn back and see to whom​ it​ belonged, his knees snapped.
Strength faded away from his limbs surprisingly easily. Pathetically fragile, he was unable to support even his head. Even an infant could hold his head still but what was this man, who had significantly aged, doing.
Such that even this frivolous talk wouldn’t come to mind, his consciousness fell into the sole of the deep, dark hole.
A vivid ache and sense of loss, scorched his brain.
Subaru: “ーーGhi.”
Whilst wanting to give rise to a shriek, he endured his voice trying to fly out by grinding his teeth.
It was not as if he would feel any better if he were to let it out. It was not as if he would feel any better if he were to not let it out. However, there were people here who would surely have their ■ shattered, if Subaru were to cry out now.
He could not allow that. Because he could not do so, stay silent and die. Natsuki Subaru.
Ley: “ーーHow nice, onii-san. So you will be going to the next one by doing tha~t?”
There echoed a voice overlooking Subaru, who had powerlessly crumbled down whilst continuing to resist his screaming.
He had endured his screaming. However, he could not possibly endure that mocking voice.
“ーーーー”
In a situation where his limbs had been rendered completely incapable of moving, he directed strength into his arm and moved his finger.
And, with a single middle finger raised, his lips moved.
Subaru: “Die, idiot.”
After that, his consciousness came to a haltーー.


△▼△▼△▼△

■ Count 2.
・ Having Emilia and Ram cooperate, aiming for an early settlement with Ley Batenkaitos, failure.
・ Timing is essential for taking over Ram’s inferior physical form through『Cor Leonis』.
・ ーーBeatrice’s surprise attack is incompatible with『Gluttony』.

△▼△▼△▼△

ーーFiercely, the enshrouding clouds of sand were trying to enwrap the field of vision.
“ーーーーHaahraan.”
With his entire body swinging around at the sensation of violently swaying about, Subaru desperately clung on, trying not to be thrown off. Ahead of him, a pigtail was shaking about left and right.
???: “ーーWork hard, Sand Earthworm-chan!”
In accordance with Meili’s call, the Sand Earthworm trembled its large build and intensely hammered in and struck its face. Being swallowed by that shock wave gave rise to an immense loss in the troops of the advancing horde of Witch Beasts.
However, those lost troops were covered in the matter of a few seconds, trampling upon the scattered corpses of their own kind, the hordes of Witch Beasts continued to push in without halting their feet. ーーThe war situation, was unfavourable.
“ーーーー”
Under their eyesーー no, in all directions, advancing in were the innumerable Witch Beasts. With those as her opponents, Meili made free use of her preparations, which in no way could be stated to be sufficient and was struggling fiercely.
Honestly speaking, Meili’s efforts, as she controlled the Witch Beast, were hard to notice by an outsider’s perspective. She ordered instructions to the Witch Beast and abiding by that the fiendish monster rampaged about. There was no mystery in that if that alone was to be observed.
Howeverーー,
Meili: “Hah, hah ~hk.”
Looking at her shape, with sweat on her forehead and her occasionally inhaling agonizingly, it could perhaps be understood at a single glance that it was a recognition too difficult to observe.
Meili: “Hah, fu~h…… enough, geez o-onii-san, treats people so rudely~.”
Wiping the sweat dripping down her chin by the back of her hand and stating some rather harsh words, Meili’s eyes had become bloodshot.
It was not as if she had directly linked with the Witch Beast like Subaru’s『Cor Leonis』but to bend the atrocious Witch Beast’s instinct as per her own notions, an immense strength of will was needed.
For Subaru, who had read her book once and personally experienced her half death, the weight of that indemnification was clearly known. That is precisely why, it had been transmitted to him.
ーーThat Meili was seriously thinking of capturing the tower, along with Subaru and the rest.
Subaru: “ーー~hk “
Meili: “He~y, onii-san!? If you don’t grab on properly, you’ll die~, you kno~w!”
Subaru: “I-I know……!”
The moment immediately after he profoundly thought of those deep emotions, his body felt as if it was being carried away in the horizontal jolts and his posture crumbled. He had momentarily withstood his ground but he was shouted at by Meili when she discovered that.
Whilst complying with those words, Subaru calmed down and clung to the protuberance of the large build.
ーーAt present, the figures of Subaru and Meili were on top of the large build of the Sand Earthworm.
Meili: “If instructions were to be given directly from a close distance​, there must be a child which listens to what is said even within children who cannot learn anything, isn’t i~t.”
Subaru: “Like I said, I never thought, I’d get to have a Witch Beast ride……!”
Swishing through the air, with his frame being jolted by the velocity of the Witch Beast’s body cutting through the atmosphere with a roar, Subaru skilfully moved around his body weight whilst stuck in admiration of Meili, who was managing the Witch Beast’s back.
This time as well, Meili’s battle with the hordes of Witch Beasts commenced from the balcony of the fourth layer.
Making use of several Sand Earthworms which had been prepared in advance, having the hordes of Witch Beasts advancing towards the watchtower suffer an attack in order to block the invasion of the Witch Beasts into the tower was Meili’s role.
However, she quickly​ gave up on the attack from the balcony, jumping onto the back of the Sand Earthworm underneath and then in one go, plunged into the Witch Beasts with vigour like that of a high wave, from the middle of its forehead.
With that heroic tactic of Meili’s, accompanying her as bait was what Subaru’s current state was.
Meili: “Really, the Witch Beast-chan’s all really love onii-san, isn’t i~t.”
Subaru: “And that’s nothing to be happy about…… ~hk.”
Looking at the excited state of the Witch Beasts drawing near, Meili sighed as they were crushed by the Sand Earthworm. Whilst agreeing with her comment, Subaru narrowed his eyes at the hurriedly approaching hordes of Witch Beasts.
Though the principle behind it was unknown, it was something he was aware of in terms of the result.
The Witch Beasts who surrounded the watchtower, strictly speaking, were not aiming for the watchtower but had gathered aiming for Subaru who was inside of it. ーーThat was, evident from this situation as well.
The spearheads of the Witch Beasts were concentrating on the extreme towards the Sand Earthworm, which was giving a ride to Meili and Subaru.
Turning their legs around, which were supposed to have been facing towards the tower, hastily making way towards this side with unraveled fangs was merely the instinct of Witch Beasts trying to kill a living being, nothing more.
Subaru: “It wasn’t as if I was half-convinced, but……”
Him having the physical constitution which attracted Witch Beasts was a peculiarity Subaru, who had been in present-day Japan till yesterday, did not even need confirmation for as a real feeling. In the past, he had gnawed the pocky for the dog kept in the neighbourhood, but could that have possibly been a symptom of the early stage of this physical constitution.
He was utterly unaware now. Though he was unawareーー,
Subaru: “It seems it’s no mistake that I am responsible for a large part of the five obstacles.”
The large hordes of Witch Beasts advancing towards the watchtower, the ones of『Gluttony』putting his approach toward​s the tower to test through Subaru’s『Memories』, Reid who took in that『Gluttony』and acquired substance, Shaula who commenced aiming for Subaru by the virtue of her transformation, the jet black shadow which swallowed the entirety of the watchtowerーー.
Looking at it back now, it was impossible to prevent the thought of the responsibility for their origin seemingly coming down onto Subaru in the truest sense. Of course, inevitability was no possible part of it.
Subaru: “My mind, is getting depressed……”
However, if the Witch Beasts, Shaula, and the jet black shadow could be lured outside of the watchtower, there may possibly form a way to break out of the deadlock of the present circumstances.
Subaru: “……It is not forbidden to destroy the『Trials』, huh.”
The fifth rule, behind capturing Pleiades Watchtower.
When he thought of the feelings of Shaula’s ■, who had hid that, he felt his chest ache but the rule he had finally fished out of her mouth granted a new viewpoint towards the place known as the Pleiades Watchtower.
It was not as if his eyes had opened innovatively by getting to know that rule.
However, granted with a scale he had never thought of, his way of looking at the world had expanded remarkably. Things which dk not exist cannot be obtained. That was, the fundamental law of the world.
To pass over the『Trial』without finishing it, to act contrary to the established routine of the『Trial』, those had been prohibited.
Without even getting involved in that, destroying the『Trial』itself had not been prohibited. What, could that mean.
What could itーー.
Subaru: “Meiーー”
Li, trying to continue his words on, that is when Subaru witnessed it.
By changing the course of the Sand Earthworm, whilst attempting to confirm whether the terrain of the watchtower’s environs were usable or not, the objective came to a standstill.
Because an assailing corona, from overhead, had scattered away the thick trunk of the Sand Earthworm.
“ーーーーHaahraaaan.”
With more than eight meters blown off of the approximately ten meter wide waist the Sand Earthworm shrieked, giving rise to its death wail.
The proceedingly lowering roar of the Witch Beast also resembled a howl, and Subaru, who had basked in that at close proximity, felt his vision dye white with its explosive intrusion into his eardrums.
Atop the Witch Beast, which had experienced that and was disseminating bluish-purple bodily fluids, having failed to stop its body from getting blown off into a thousand scraps from both the front and back of its trunk, Subaru and Meili’s bodies were thrown down.
Subaru: “ーーAh.”
Meili: “Ghーー ~hk!”
Instantaneously stretching out his hand, he took Meili’s petite body within his arms.
Patting his shoulder and trying to call out to him was a byproduct of it. By reflexively leaning his body forward, he had been able to catch her falling body.
However, that had not been a drastic settlement. The Sand Earthworm’s large frame somersaulted, and not only Meili but Subaru had also been thrown off.
Even if he were to pull her in, in the end, they would fall on top of the sand, a place entirely surrounded by Witch Beasts.
Should that happen, the two of them would become feed for the Witch Beasts whilst they attempted to reorganise themselves.
Above allーー,
Subaru: “ーーShaula.”
Clinging to the outer wall of the tower with its tail stinger facing towards Subaru and the rest, the titanic scorpionーー Shaula, with her large build slipped into the twilight, she was distantly visible having made her appearance.
They were out of time.
Within the tower, someone broke the rule. In accordance with that, Shaula lost her self and transformed into the titanic scorpion and just as what she had reported about herself, she commenced attacking, aiming for Subaru.
That single bomb had scattered away the Sand Earthworm’s trunk, and mid air, towards Subaru and Meiliーー,
Meili: “Onii-sa…… ~hk.”
Hugging Meili tightly, who was within his arms and had raised a voice as that of a scream, Subaru did not let his eyes avert from the titanic scorpionーー no, Shaula. The red compound eyes emitted a distinct glow within the presence of night and the line of sight unbeknownst to any course of action, clearly understood its aim was Subaru upon looking at him.
Light gathered at the tail stinger, and now once again, a corona was fired.
They would get vapourized away should they be struck by that. However, they must not get struck by that.
He wanted to avoid being killed by Shaula, regardless of how much that may abrade away his ■. If he were to bend away from that notion, he would surely become a miscreant then.
However, a way to defend themselves while they were mid air was.
“ーーーーHaahraan.”
The moment the corona was fired, the Sand Earthworm writhing in agony thrusted itself above the line of fire. Was that simply the instinctive movement of the Sand Earthworm or did Meili influence it in some way, he did not know.
However, the single blast Shaula had fired had been avoided at the moment when it was supposed to have vaporized Subaru away.
Andーー,
Subaru: “Gah, gugh.”
With vehement vigour, Subaru and the rest fell on top of the sand from their sands.
Meili, who was strongly embraced within Subaru’s arms, was perhaps safe. However, Subaru himself had not been safe. Unable to defend himself, he had gotten his head within the extensive sand.
A dull sound echoed, the joints of his bones, which must be avoided from getting smashed, had gotten broken.
At that instant, his field of vision was rendered completely black.
His nerves, which must be avoided from getting slashed, had gotten cut a thousand​ times.
Not only what was visible to his eyes, but sounds, sensations, anything and everything turned distant.
Merely his nose remained alive. It was baffling. The nose, which was not even expected to be capable of doing something useful normally. For some reason, till the very end of the end, he could sense scents.
The sweet, scent.
Within his arms, having been there till recently, that sweet scent.
Perhaps, yet remaining alive, that sceーー.

△▼△▼△▼△

■ Count 7.
・ Escaping outside of the tower, the effectiveness of luring away the Witch Beasts.
・ The Witch Beasts’ aim is Subaru. The aim of the shadow and titanic scorpion as well, is perhaps the same.
・ ーーWith Natsuki Subaru alone, Meili cannot be protected.

△▼△▼△▼△

Subaru: “Ghuーー”
Enduring the nausea welling up within him, Subaru glanced at the front once again.
Stepping firmly, pouring immense strength in the legs, he somehow managed to have his body remain still. His anguish had not been eased. He was merely skilfully deceiving his anguish.
???: “Hiyah! Hiyayah! Eiyah!”
Crushing the bitterness of gastric juices in his teeth was Subaru and in front of him, fiercely welding two ice swords was Emilia. Evading those attacks of Emilia’s calmly, with a deriding smile was the bitter enemy he was tired of looking at, Ley Batenkaitos.
“ーーーー”
Since the restart point of『Return by Death』had been set up to the moment immediately following the confrontation with Louis Arneb in the『Book of the Dead』, Emilia and『Gluttony’s』encounter was inevitable.
At the point in time Subaru had『Returned by Death』to, the battle between Emilia and『Gluttony』had already commenced.
The simple way to change situations was to tamper with the match-making. However, by activating『Cor Leonis』immediately after『Returning by Death』Subaru was able to see the positions of his comrades within the tower, and he naturally​ understood​ that this fight was unavoidable.
Henceforth, he did not have the situation of the tag team of Emilia and Ram fighting Ley change.
ーーHowever, something could be done about that in its own way.
Subaru: “ーーJulius!”
Julius: “I know!”
At Subaru’s sharp call, in accordance with that, a single shadow stepped in.
That was, with a knight sword in his grip and running through the frozen aisle, Julius. Having his light purple hair flutter in the icy wind he commenced his gallant piercing sprint from a lower posture.
Ley: “Haha ~tsu! Even the nameless knight-sama shall be partaking in the battle hu~h!”
Julius: “Unfortunately, if that was intended to be a provocation then that is quite weak. Subaru pricks at spots much more painful.”
Ley: “You know, despite being comrades, what’s up with that?”
Brushing away the advancing piercing bolt with his dagger, Ley and Julius exchanged words at close proximity. Even in the midst of that sword strikes unfolded between the two, and exchanges of special moves, opposite to the content of their conversation, were being performed.
ーーHaving Julius accompany them to this place, was a type of a gamble.
When the five obstacles had attacked the watchtower for the first time, Subaru had Julius accompany them for going around this as well. At that time, Emilia had gotten her『Name』eaten and her cooperation with Julius, who had been rendered unknowing to her battle style, had been shoddy and lacked the ability to corner『Gluttony』.
Howeverーー,
Subaru: “This time, nobody has forgotten Emilia-chan. On top of that……”
Emilia and Julius’ coordination attempted to soundly counter Ley. At that point, ahead of Subaru’s line of sight, was the shadow of a person kicking the ceiling and making a sudden descentーー Ram severely cut in between.
Of course, increasing her fighting strength through『Cor Leonis』was Subaru’s greatest duty. That had been practiced this time as well, and Ram advanced closer to Ley’s torso with unordinary body handling.
And,
Ram: “Just, kindly take the exit already.”
Ley: “Ghu, egh.”
Cold words, and her palm, with equal sharpness, drove into Ley’s side. At the palm strike aiming to directly impact the internal organs through the gaps in ribs, and a distinct rumble of pain spilled through Ley’s lips.
At the same pace, Ram’s knee tried assaulting the snapping body which then got blocked, but grabbing the hair of her opponent from the back of his head she slammed him onto the floor. On top of that, she consecutively swung down her heel into his face.
Merciless might, continuous attacks, those were the only way to drive Ley into certain defeat.
However, this had been far from being sufficient for damaging Ley. The heel Ram swung down onto his face, having grabbed that slender ankle whilst lying down, he glared at Ram from below with a bloodstained evil countenance.
Ley: “Nee-sama, cau~ght……”
Emilia: “Hiryah!!”
Ley: “ーーGah ~tsu!?”
Ley expressed a smile on his evil countenance and his body, from a directly horizontal attackーー by the ice hammer given shape to and swung by Emilia like a golf swing, got blown off.
It was a nice save, just when he was about to put his wickedness to work by grabbing Ram’s leg. At Ley, who went rolling and somersaulting skilfully, Emilia gallantly raised her eyebrows and puffed up her chest.
???: “……As merciless, as always, I suppose.”
Beatrice, while supporting his body right by his side, whispered in response to those actions of Emilia’s with admiration, amazement, and somewhat pride.
The truth is, Subaru felt the same. She had a cute face, she could truly be relied​ upon.
Ram: “Emilia-sama, gratitude for the rescue.”
Emilia: “Mhm, it’s fine. Ram got grabbed because she’s moving around this much, after all. Julius as well, thank you for coming here.”
Julius: “Not at all,『Gluttony』is an opponent I am deeply connected to as well. Rather, my deepest apologies for exposing Emilia-sama and Miss Ram to danger. This was originally supposed to be a spot where I would tell you to kindly stand back, but……”
Ram: “With that as the opponent, there must be no room to be acting upon chivalry or gentlemanliness, isn’t it.”
Whilst hugging her elbows, Ram flatly intercepted Julius’ words. Even Julius could not refuse that. It seemed as if he felt ashamed of his feelings towards that itself.
There is a certain style to battle, there are certain rules to warriors.
However, adhering to that and becoming too obsessed over pride would result in large losses. ーーFor Julius, this was a difficult spot. However, there was no choice for him but to respond to it.
At the very least, with the Sin Archbishop of『Gluttony』, an atrocious gang as the enemyーー,
Ley: “……A~h, you sure are doing it. To do this much with us as the opponent is quite something.”
Saying that, the aforementioned Sin Archbishop stood up while shaking his head.
Whether that was him resounding having received Emilia’s heroic blow from his shoulder, his right arm was still loosely handing down. Possibly, the shoulder bones had perhaps been fractured.
If that was true, then it could be said it was possibly fatal for the Authority of Ley Batenkaitos, of reconstructing battle styles through『Memories』. No matter how proficient a battle style may be, it would be rendered meaningless if it was not exercised perfectly.
Subaru: “……Or instead, by substituting with the little sister, are you going to be switching the body and everything to the other?”
Ley: “ーー. Waha~n, we see, huh. Onii-san is aware of our『Solar Eclipse』and『Lunar Eclipse』is what that means. Well well, got seen through, isn’t it. But you kno~w”
Putting an abrupt halt to his words,『Gluttony』carefreely stuck his tongue out as if mocking Subaru and the rest. Though Subaru furrowed his eyebrows to that gesture, the answer was provided immediately.
That wasーー,
Ley: “ーーIn such a disadvantageous situation, i~s there any meaning for us to still continue fighting?”
Subaru: “ーー~hk! Not good!”
Obvious logic, Subaru shouted while cursing the shallowness of his own thought.
Hearing that call of Subaru’s, Emilia and the others also seemingly reached the same thought, but they were too late.
Ley: “Baha~hayee.”
Lightly swinging his hand, Ley’s figure jumped over the space.
Using the odd talent of the『Leaper』, he erased his form from the aisle.
Julius: “Stay on the lookout for the surroundings! We don’t know where he may appear from yet!”
Ram: “ーーIt is futile. That bunch, once they are allowed to get away, they escape. That must be why, they haven’t been caught even once yet, isn’t it.”
Rendering his form invisible was『Gluttony』, Julius called for vigilance for his surprise attack but Ram probed into the situation with composure whilst shaking her head left and right.
Subaru too felt the same as Ram. Just as the words Ley had left, there lay not a single reason for him to continue fighting in such a disadvantageous situation.
Ley Batenkaitos, was a Sin Archbishop, not a warrior.
He did not possess the qualities of continuing to fight until the very end, or enjoying hard battles either. According to Louis’ statement, what they desired was the greatest life, the itinerary of optimum solutions.
ーーThe hazards of hard battles or defeat, those could not even be forgotten desires for them.
Emilia: “……Then, it’s over already?”
Dumbfounded, Emilia whispered whilst reducing the ice hammer she held in her hand to air.
In those words was not the relief of the enemy having disappeared, but the disappointment having let a bitter enemy slip from their handsーー no, something differing furthermore, despondency.
The reply to that despondency, wasーー,
Ram: “ーーJust, a little bit more and yet!”
“ーーーー”
Ram: “Just, a single step more, and the bunch who made Rem go through all that could have been…… ~hk.”
Kneeling down, Ram raised a high-pitched voice.
She powerfully struck her fist to the aisle’s floor, trembling her voice regarding『Gluttony』, who had artfully succeeded in running away.
Everyone in this place was painfully aware, of the feelings of her regretful self.
The reason why Emilia prevaricated her words, why Julius hid his yellow eyes, why Beatrice, beside Subaru, lowered her shoulders, all of it collected upon that.
They had come to possess a sudden clue.
However, unlike relying on knowledge of the tower, enquiring『Gluttony』about the damage dealt by the Authority of『Gluttony』directly was a way that had been thought over with certainty.
To have that slip away from right in front of the eyes, it was obvious to feel despondency for that.
Subaru: “……With this, Ley has been repelled away, is that what it would mean?”
Understanding the feelings of Ram’s ■ sinking deep into lamentation​, Subaru possessed a different kind of doubt.
Seeing the disadvantage of three against one, Ley decided to withdraw from this spot. However, speaking in terms of whether he had withdrawn completely as a threat to the watchtower, that was yet unclear.
Though Ram had informed Julius of the futility of looking out for a surprise attack, that was something limited to only this place. Within the tower, dangerous『Gluttony』were wandering around, that situation yet remained unchanged.
If so then it could not possibly be said that one of the five obstacles had been eliminated.
On the contrary, they had left an opponent about whom they had no idea where he may clash in from, to take care of himself, that was all there was to it.
Subaru: “ーー~hk, should the guy who escaped be ran after, or should another problem be looked after. At any right, right now……”
???: “ーーThe thin’ known as a situation’s all ’bout the opponent, where ya should be movin’ ’round without thinkin’ anythin’.”
“ーーーー”
Suddenly, the moment he was giving consideration to the possibility of not making a move, he felt his hair rise at the voice which originated from​ behind. When everyone turned back instantly, slow footsteps approached from ahead of the aisle.
Their owner, as if simply taking a walk without halting a single step, that was not something the aforementioned bunch would do.
For some reason.
???: “I’m takin’ a walk ’round my garden, yet why’d I be worryin’ ’bout other fellas?”
Boldly, without feeling shy for a single thing, the manーー the figure of Reid who descended down from the second layer, at that Subaru felt the situation deteriorate further.
Keeping the issue of Reid for later he had hastened Ley Batenkaitos’ subjugation, but in terms of results, Ley had escaped and obstructing Reid’s revival had completely failedーー,
Emilia: “Since when, did this tower become your garden?”
Reid: “Heyhey, don’tcha go ’round havin’ misunderstandin’s, fiercely frizzlin’. Lemme tell ya, when I said garden I wasn’t refferin’ to this gloomy tower. You, ain’t it obvious I’d​ be callin’ the whole damn world’s my garden.”
Julius: “……If the man who became legend by a single swing of sword says that, then that comment must not be a trifling matter.”
At the arrival of Reid, who was not supposed to be able to leave the second layer, Emilia and Julius fired their own respective astonishment and words. The response to that was extremely typical of Reid, that could be stated straightforwardly.
For this warrior who surpassed all human intellect, the idea of thinking over his footstepsーー no, not just footsteps. The thought of taking other people into consideration, was completely out of the balance.
Ram: “ーーWhy, have you descended down here? You were not supposed to be able to leave that floor, isn’t that so, trial taker.”
Reid: “Talkin’ to women knelt down and sunken ain’t to my likin’. If ya want me to answer then try requestin’. I don’t think strong-hearted women’re bad. Though I don’t think weak-hearted women’re bad either.”
Ram: “Is that so. ーーSuch a sleazebag.”
Without expecting a direct response, Ram promptly halted her response to Reid.
The next instant, Ram, who had kicked the floor with enough force to burst it open, rushed towards the opposing Reid’s bottom in a straight line and turning into a pink whirlwind, leapt towards the『Sword Saint』standing bolt upright.
At the same pace, making the best use of her petite build, a high speed rotating kick was fired from her heel towards Reid’s head. Without any exaggeration, a kick strike with enough force to mow down his head.
It was a stark kick which, if it landed a direct hit, would blow off his head physically, if not that then at the very least, his consciousness.
Of course, the respective recoil would flow into Subaru from Ram and ache like a strike of lightning would bolt through his body.
Subaru: “Ghu, ghu~u~u~ ~hk.”
It is said that when an artery explodes, it pains to an inconceivable level. Right now, it could be boasted that what was running through Subaru’s entire body was something close to that.
Ram’s attack which had been unleashed to this extent, the fruits it bore wereーー,
Reid: “Not bad. But, that’s all it’s​ got. Had it been Trisha she would’ve broken the floor with a single blow, ya know.”
Ram: “……Monster.”
Reid: “Don’t lump me together with somethin’ like monsters. There’s gotta be a limit to how low my worth can be, ya know.”
Intercepting the kicking leg, he had the impact flow into the ground.
Having been witnessed earlier, physical attack killingーー that made the floor and walls of the aisle develop cracks, however, the damage to Reid himself had been blocked perfectly.
And, towards Ram’s abdomen, who had halted movementーー,
Reid: “Here, try endurin’ this, you.”
Spinning and turning around his body once, Reid’s bulky and sturdy leg sprang up. At the same pace, the sole of his foot captured Ram’s body and swept it right upwards energetically.
Ram: “Kafugh.”
With the air within her lungs squeezed out, Ram’s lips, as she widened her eyes, vomited a large amount of blood out. Whilst bathing in that without evading it, Reid narrowed his eye unconcealed by the eyepatch and distorted his lips.
However, immediately opening​ up his narrowed eye again, he spilled out “The he~ll?” with his voice.
Ram: “It was successful, wasn’t it.”
At that instant Ram grasped the leg caved into her abdomen and using her entire body, settled the joint of her knee. With an attitude as if unaffected by the impact of the strike which had pierced through her abdomen. Seeing that, Reid carved a puzzled expressionーー,
Reid: “ーーThe heck. Ya’re behind this too aye, young fish.”
“ーーーー”
With a damp voice, he told Subaru, who gnashed his molars at the anguish like a bowling ball had been thrown into the pit of his stomach.
Emilia: “ーー~hk, no! Don’t get any closer to Subaru!”
Immediately afterwards Emilia stepped ahead upon observing hazardous emotions levitating across Reid’s blue eyes. However, upon her advance Reid swung his arm in annoyance, purloining the ice sword driven into him and mercilessly struck Emilia’s shoulder with its handle, and energetically kicked her after she fell down.
Emilia: “Ah ~hk!”
Reid: “Ya’re in my way.”
Receiving the kick, Emilia got physically blown away. Much frighteningly, Reid did that with the leg whose knee was supposed to be captured in grip.
In other words, whilst continuing to have Ram cling to his leg, he had kicked and sent Emilia flying. In the end, no matter how much strength Ram may pour in, it could not do anything to Reid’s knee.
Ram: “Kgh, his limits know no end!”
Julius: “ーーPrepare yourself!”
Casting aside the advantage of locking him, Ram, like a chess piece, and Julius drew near him alongside.
However, the result of the attacks of the two was just as miserable.
His kick and his hand being used like a sword shot down Ram and Julius respectively, who were supposed to be at the pinnacle as warriors. Ram had her neck struck, Julius had his leg broken, all of them rendered incapable of standing.
Subaru: “ーーShit.”
And, in the aisle where comrades had fallen, Reid approached further, having literally eliminated the obstacles in his way. In front of his eyes was merely the groggy Subaru, who had taken up Emilia and others’ damage, and Beatrice, who had spread both of her arms wide as if shielding that Subaru.
Subaru: “Bea…… it’s no use……”
Beatrice: “It doesn’t matter if it’s no use or if it’s absurd, in fact. This is property protection of Subaru…… in this case, it is a special field of Betty’s, Subaru’s partner as well, I suppose.”
Beatrice’s voice of acting strong, right now, echoed far too vainly.
Even when trying to respond to that strong spirit of Beatrice’s, Subaru’s hands, legs, made no reaction to the fighting spirit. What Subaru had taken up was only damage, which seemingly rendered the actions of his comrades futile.
Three of them were merely conscious, that was the fruit their willpower bore.
Beatrice: “Reid, why are you aiming for Betty and the others…… for Subaru, in fact?”
Reid: “Cause it’s in the middle of the『Trial』, sayin’ that’d be a pretty outdated response. My original plan aside, that actually goes for that pretty one……”
Beatrice: “So what, I suppose.”
Reid: “By meetin’ that one firsthand, my mind changed. It’s disgustin’, so I’ll erase him.”
A judgement grounded on peculiar sensitivity, conversation could not work against such an opponent.
At the same time, with the possibility of him turning over his view wiped out Beatrice gnashed her pretty molars and glanced at Subaru lying behind, who had crumbled down and had been rendered immobile.
“ーーーー”
The reason why she took a tiny breath, was because she resolved her preparedness to fight and protect Subaru.
He wanted to tell her, to run away. However, what spilled out of Subaru’s lips was merely a hoarse breath.
Reid: “There ain’t any need for ya to go outta yer way and rush to yer death ya know, kid.”
Beatrice: “Unfortunately enough, living as if dead is utterly unwelcome at this point.”
Reid: “Hu~h, that so. Then, there ain’t any choice.”
With his name bearing the expression of a hero and a legend, he would not hurt a girl child.
Believing such thoughts to be as though illusions, the glint in Reid’s eye remained firm. It seemed to be sentencing as if the one standing in his path was naught but an infant.
Henceforth, without expecting any benevolence of ■, Beatrice was the first one to use all her might.
Beatrice: “Ul Minya.”
The emerging countless violet arrows submerged the aisle entirely, and completely blocked off any paths for Reid to escape through.
To fatally wound with the slightest contact was the special trait of Minya’s, fathoming that with a single glance, without flinching whatsoever, Reid curved his lips.
Beatrice: “Natsuki Subaru’s Great Spirit, Beatrice.”
Reid: “Good goin’. ーー『Stick Swinger』, Reid Astrea.”
With the mutual exchange of names, the atmosphere froze. Beatrice, with the violet crystals spread out in the air, and Reid, having picked up Julius’ knight sword that had fallen at his feet, prepared themselves.
“ーーーー”
Until the very end of the end, Subaru was unable to voice anything.
However, he kept his eyes open, he never closed them for even an instant.
His own decisions and choices, from the results they bore, he had been unable to avert his eyes.
He had been unable to avert themーー.


△▼△▼△▼△

■ Count 15.
・『Gluttony』deserts, upon observing the situation to be visibly unfavourable.
・ Neglected Reid ultimately comes to kill Subaru with absolute certainty.
・ ーーNever again, will he let someone die before his own self.

△▼△▼△▼△

Subaru: “Beatrice ~hk.”
???: “Wah!? W-What happened, I suppose!? Subaru!? Subaru!?”
The moment he opened his eyes, he hugged the young girl before him without any forethought.
Astonished by the sudden action, the young girlーー Beatrice, stiffened her petite body.
It was his reunion with her, who had persisted with tragic preparedness until the previous moment. It turned​ into relief within his chest, along with unbearable guilt that breathed a painful wind into his ■.
Subaru: “Beatrice……”
He was grateful, he was able to meet her again.
Along with that, he felt apologetic for having her go through all of that.
Beatrice: “Subaru?”
Subaru: “ーーNo, it’s nothing. I do remember. You are Beatrice, I am Natsuki Subaru. You and I, are each other’s partners, now onwards too, please take care of me, please have fun with me, very good.”
Beatrice: “V-Very good, in fact……”
Beatrice, perplexed, raised her thumb at Subaru’s rhythmic words.
It was an expression that must not be existing in this different world, so it must be the result of Subaru poisoning her with it. Patting that head of hers, Subaru took in a deep inhale, and exhaled shortly.
Following that he switched over his consciousness, believing he must grasp the situationーー,
Beatrice: “Calm down, I suppose, Subaru.”
Subaru: “Eh?”
Beatrice: “Properly tell what happened, in fact. Did something happen inside the book, I suppose? Were Reid’s memories displayed? Betty aside, what about Emilia and everyone? Confirm whether you remember them, in fact. Properly recall, all things precious, I suppose.”
Subaru: “T-That’s…… yeah, hm, that’s right.”
Holding both of Subaru’s cheeks in her hands, Beatrice brought that to attention.
Hearing those words of her’s, in front​ of her hurried self he fell into slight reflection. It was a phenomenon that might happen to someone who was looping often.
For an individual piling up loops, the fresh taste of a happening eventually fades away.
With that, experience points gained with people for whom that happening is for the first time and react accordingly slips off, and suddenly people start to appear as not being peopleーー,
Subaru: “……I never thought, I’d be in that position.”
In those kinds of works, the mind and body falls into that state due to trials run tens, hundreds or times even more than that.
Compared to that, for Subaru it wasーー merely, the fifteenth time.
To stop thinking of people as people in merely fifteen times, perhaps it could be said his ■ was turning harsher.
Subaru: “Am I an idiot. No, I am an idiot.”
Casting away the weak, brittle, pathetic nature of his own ■, Subaru braced his mind.
He had only, died fifteen times yet, that is all. Without having made any progress, he had merely exhausted his life in indolence. How come did his such self, hold any right to proclaim that he was exhausted.
Such a thing did not exist for him. It did not.
Stand up, raise your face, clench your fists, Natsuki Subaru.
There’s nobody else except you. Except you.
ーーHad it been『Natsuki Subaru』, such failures never would have.
Beatrice: “ーーFrom the very beginning, Subaru has never been some superman capable of doing everything, in fact.”
“ーーーー”
Suddenly, Beatrice told Subaru, who had been repeatedly wondering to himself.
Subaru inhaled upon that comment and widened his eyes. Gazing into those black eyes of Subaru’s straightforwardly, Beatrice shook her head left and right, conceiving grief in her blue eyes.
Beatrice: “It can be said countless times, I suppose. Subaru is no such superman who can do anything, in fact. Always frantic about what lies in front, gets hurt for everyone’s sake…… even enduring pain is not something he is good at, he is a normal boy, I suppose.”
Subaru: “T-That’s not, possible. That’s not. After all, it should be that way……”
Beatrice: “It should be that way?”
Subaru: “It should be that way, only then can this……”
He firmly gripped to the pit of his stomach, gritting his molars, thinking back to the wounds of his arm, to the wounds within his body, to his arms which had grown slightly sturdier, to everyone who relied upon Subaru, to Emilia, to Beatrice, to Ram, to Julius, to Echidna, to Meili, to Shaula.
His guts were rumbling such that it was irritating.
They were rashly pushing away, more than the moment of being on the verge of death, but perhaps Subaru’s ■.
???: “So you have returned, Natsuki-kun…… Did something, happen?”
???: “Geez onii-sa~n, just when I thought you’ve worried everyone, it’s because of tha~t? No fighting with Beatrice-chan now onwa~rds.”
Disputing with Subaru and Beatriceーー no, it was nothing so stern.
However, looking at the state of the two facing him, they were Meili and Echidna returning from their patrolling of the library. Neither could he look at the faces of those two straightforwardly.
Echidna: “Beatrice, did something happen to Natsuki-kun? Was the impact, indeed, too much?”
Beatrice: “……It’s not as if that’s not true, in fact. But, Betty and the rest’s proper thought was far too lacking for Subaru, who had to experience that misery, I suppose.”
Echidna: “That is……”
Echidna furrowed her eyebrows at Beatrice, who turned her gaze downwards after staring at Subaru. However, she immediately pulled her chin in, as if having judged the circumstances,
Echidna: “Shaula, who had jumped out, and Julius, who went after her have not returned. I am also worried about Emilia-san and Ram-san who went to see Rem-san. I would like to join up with at least either of them, but……”
Beatrice: “……Echidna and Meili, head to the balcony, in fact. Betty will head to the Green Room and search for Emilia, I suppose. Stay sufficiently careful, in fact.”
Meili: “That’s okay bu~t, what’s onii-san going to do~?”
At Beatrice’s brisk instruction, Echidna and Meili’s lines of sight turned towards Subaru.
At those gazes, naturally, Subaru wanted to say he would accompany Beatrice but,
Beatrice: “ーーSubaru, will quietly stay here, I suppose.”
Subaru: “Wha……! Don’t say stupid stuff, Beatrice! I’m alright! My senses may certainly have dulled down after returning from the book but, they’ll immediately be in their place……!”
Informed by the standing Beatrice, Subaru reflexively snarled at those words. At the same pace, he poured strength into his legs in order to stand at the same level as them.
He poured strength into his legs butーー,
Subaru: “ーーAh?”
Beatrice: “Be in their place and, what then, in fact?”
At Beatrice’s question, Subaru looked down onto his legs in astonishment. Even if he tried to pour strength somehow, especially into his knees, he was unable to retain balance.
No matter what he did, his posture crumbled, and he was unable to stand up.
Subaru: “Why……”
Beatrice: “It’s a matter of course, I suppose. Subaru is always, working too hard, in fact.”
Subaru: “No, wait, please wait! Everything somehow working out when I’m at this level, that’s……”
“ーーーー”
Subaru: “That’s, not possible. I am……”
Shaking his head left and right in refusal, no matter how many times he tried, the result remained unchanged.
Even though he possessed no pain, no anguish, no fatigue, his will did not get conveyed to his limbs. And whilst he remained occupied with that, Beatrice ultimately took a single step in the direction of the staircase.
Beatrice: “ーーSubaru, Betty and the rest will cover whatever remains lacking, I suppose. That is why, you don’t have to think of doing anything and everything all alone, in fact, after all”
Subaru: “Beatrice……”
Beatrice: “After all, that is Natsuki Subaru, I suppose.”
Leaving behind a smile for Subaru, who widened his eyes in astonishment, Beatrice dashed. As if equalling her energy, Echidna and Meili also turned their backs towards Subaru,
Echidna: “Natsuki-kun, I have expectations from you. That you still might be able to give one last push.”
Meili: “I think​ it’s fine if you rest. But, it was onii-san who said some pretty grand stuff to me so~, work hard on that a bit more.”
Saying all they had to say, the figures of the three disappeared from the library, leaving Subaru behind, whom they had all spoken to.
If they were to take the staircase from the third layer, the three will encounter Julius, who must be making his way back around this timing. Or perhaps at this rate, Julius would not come and drag Subaru out, he had embraced that expectation as wellーー,
Subaru: “No way, he’d come…… if Beatrice, says all that.”
He respected that.
Much less, the Subaru after returning from the『Book of the Dead』had been seen by the two of Echidna and Meili. There was no way their kind selves, would not relay that.
However, that solicitude came at the cost of life. Even though, he did not want to see someone among his comrades die before him.
Subaru: “All because, I’m so weak…… because I’m losing my spirit, at just this level, why.”
Had it been the true『Natsuki Subaru』, he must not have halted his feet by just this. His rage towards his own worthless self, gave rise to warmth in Subaru’s chest.
However, alongside that, a separate feeling was also gushing forth.
That was, the words Beatrice had left behind.
‘ーーFrom the very beginning, Subaru has never been some superman capable of doing everything, in fact.’
‘It can be said countless times, I suppose. Subaru is no such superman who can do anything, in fact. Always frantic about what lies in front, gets hurt for everyone’s sake…… even enduring pain is not something he is good at, he is a normal boy, I suppose.’
What Beatrice had recited, the image of the『Natsuki Subaru』not present here.
Despite hearing that, Subaru was unable to believe that. It was difficult to believe in. After all, in accordance with that, that would truly mean he was just a normal human, isn’t it.
Subaru: “Something, must have happened. That must have changed you, isn’t it,『Natsuki Subaru』……”
Something, like an extravagant meeting with someone.
Something, like attaining an unbelievable power.
Something, like experiencing something his current self couldn’t even imagine.
Because something must have happened, which had allowed him to grow out of being the hopeless Natsuki Subaru, that『Natsuki Subaru』must have won the faith of everyone in his life in a different world.
Subaru: “It has to be like that……”
Without change, beating his legs, Subaru rolled up the sleeves of his clothes. Over there, a sarcoma with its origins not within Subaru’s memories had engraved a pattern.
Personally experiencing as if taking responsibility for that seeming curse over his body, its root perhaps still remained without changing. That was not possible.
That is why,『Natsuki Subaru』wasーー,
Subaru: “『Natsuki Subaru』, I summon you……”
Suddenly, what he had mouthed was the genesis of the suspicion he harboured for this world’s『Natsuki Subaru』.
The message for the existence absent here who had, upon times, engraved upon his arm, upon times, composed as if it were a curse and inscribed it on the room.
Seemingly finding it to be as if hexing someone who had stolen away the role which originally belonged to himself.
Subaru: “If, you really are within me, then…… come out now……!”
Gripping his arms powerfully, with strength such that his bones would grate, Subaru called for『Natsuki Subaru』who was withinーー no, who was not present here.
The existence who could achieve ideals which Subaru, who was present here, could never attain. He asked『Natsuki Subaru』to come out, if he was here.
Subaru: “Come, come, come……! Show yourself,『Natsuki Subaru』!!”
His arms had been lacking, so he latched to his neck with his hands. Of course, the deed of strangling oneself with his own hands, neither was it easy, nor could it be properly done.
In the first place, something as convenient as『Natsuki Subaru』showing his face when his life was in a predicament would never occur. Had that been the trigger, Subaru would have drawn him close twenty times now.
Just how many times『Natsuki Subaru』would have shown his face through that.
Subaru: “Shit, shit, shit…..! I am! I can’t, do it! You’re needed for this,『Natsuki Subaru』!”
Seizing the grasp on his trembling knees, Subaru powerfully struck the floor with his fist. Though his fist pained upon striking the floor of the library of unknown material properties, it could not possibly equal the sense of hopelessness tormenting his chest.
He wanted to save them. He truly, wanted to save everyone.
Nobody was in the wrong. Nobody would mutually hurt each other. He knew that. He could believe, without any wavering, that he could save, that he could love everything.
Even though he wanted to save his beloved everyone, he did not possess the power to save them.
Subaru: “Precisely now, is when you are needed, isn’t it…… and yet, why is it me. My weak, cowardly self, cannot save…… and yet.”
Even now, his legs could not move.
Due to that, he ended up making Beatrice, Echidna, Meili, those who had not been here, Emilia, Ram, Julius, Shaula, face their point of death.
Because Subaru had not been able to do anything, they, who had been destined to die, could not be saved.
Subaru: “……『Cor Leonis』.”
Whispering weakly, Subaru activated his own Authority, in order to be wounded.
The power of the『Little King』that dwelled within him immediately reported the positions of his comrades within the tower. On top of that, the reality of them heading to face their own end, of the tower heading to its demise.
Distant, having unrolled a violent battle, that light was Emilia. This time, Ram, who was supposed to stay by her side, her light was slightly distanced awayーー two separate lights, Patrasche and, Rem. She was accompanying them.
In the balcony, Shaula was struggling fiercely, and perhaps Meili had joined together there with her. Julius and Echidna seem to be moving together, and Beatrice, acting independently, was heading towards Emilia and the others is what he comprehended.
The flow was precisely as Beatrice’s instructions, and Subaru’s knowledge of the situation.
At the same pace, the current circumstance headed towards failure as wellーー.
Subaru: “ーー?”
With his mind directed by such negative thoughts, Subaru picked up a curious sense of discomfort.
As he turned his head towards his hindーー Subaru took an extensive look of the enormous library, filled with countless『Books of the Dead』,『Taygeta』.
“ーーーー”
It was an odd sensation.
Unmistakably, it was a sensation he was feeling for the first time. After all, ever since he grew conscious of his Authority of『Cor Leonis』, he had been activating it at this spot after『Returning by Death』.
Each time after that, Subaru headed for his comrades below, changing the cards he played repeatedly, running about for the sake of changing the situation, ultimately using and exhausting his own life.
That is why, activating the Authority in『Taygeta』was a matter of course for him.
However, after what Beatrice told him, stopping his feet here, a single step distant from the core and getting to overlook the situations within the tower, might have been the origin of this.
Thanks to that, what could this have been,
Subaru: “ーーThis, response is.”
Faintly, he could feel it, so dim that it felt as if it was about to disappear.
It was distant from his comrades within the tower, however, when compared to being felt with certainty, it was a fleeting, frail sensationーー but a sensation that was certainly present there.
Pushing himself and having his trembling legs move, Subaru advanced tardily like a caterpillar. After that, he quickly had his body lean onto the bookshelf and elevated his upper body with all his might.
Somehow leaning his body weight on the bookshelf, he stood up. And he stretched his hand out to the frail light about to disappear, and grasped it.
That grasped light, a single『Book of the Dead』, drawing that outーー,
“ーーーー”
He gulped down a single inhale.
A single book, with just the title upon its black binding, a book terribly dull and stale.
However, it possessed profound meaning for Subaru.
Becauseーー,
Subaru: “ーーNatsuki Subaru.”
ーーThere present was, the『Book of the Dead』not supposed to be there.
(Translation Note : The『Book of the Dead』has Natsuki Subaru’s name in Kanji (菜月・昴) instead of Katakana (ナツキ・スバル).)
"
Chapter 73,” “Natsuki Subaru” “,"ーーWith the 『Book of the Dead』 which had 『Natsuki Subaru』 inscribed on it in his hands, he stood still.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

Widening his dark eyes in astonishment, Subaru felt his throat rapidly turning parched.
Modest expressions such as astonishing or stupefying would be far too lacking. What had struck Subaru at that moment was something much more serious, something as if numbing harm.
A lethal toxic which would wield affect only when used on Subaru, and nobody elseーー.

The 『Book of the Dead』 of 『Natsuki Subaru』, was piercing through Subaru whilst commanding such powerful connotation.

Subaru: “Wh, y……”

So, the 『Book of the Dead』 not supposed to be here was present here.
What was supposed to be present in the third layer of Pleiades Watchtower, 『Taygeta』 were the 『Books of the Dead』 recording the lives of the departed. Having the book of a living being was contradictory.
Or perhaps, could this mean he simply, by chance, had found the book of a human with the same name and surname.

Subaru: “That would have actually been convincing, had this not been a different world……”

The possibility that rose to the surface in his mind, was instantly repudiated.
Though it was a matter of course, this place was a different worldーー in this place, where even the rules of naming would be vastly different from what Subaru was aware of, why would a name like 『Natsuki Subaru』 take birth here.
Even before that, there lay a decisive issue.

The title of that book of 『Natsuki Subaru』, had been written in Kanji.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

From what all Subaru had witnessed till now, even letters were disparate in this different world. That is why, even if someone else, aside from Subaru, who did not know of the world’s letters were to see it, they would probably perceive this title as if being hieroglyphic characters or something of that sort.
If that were to be considered, the unbelievable chances of Subaru finding the 『Book of the Dead』 of 『Natsuki Subaru』 here through sheer luck wereーー,

Subaru: “ーーIt’s predetermined and established, whom this belongs to.”

He could only think of that being true.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

Once again, with the 『Book of the Dead』 in his hands, Subaru silenced himself and pondered.
The reason why Subaru happened upon this 『Book of the Dead』, was because he had depended upon the dim response he had spied out through 『Cor Leonis』.
This had not been the first or second time he had searched for a book in the library, though Subaru was mindful of it, discovering the book being aimed for in this enormous archive was a deed next to impossible to achieve.
Perhaps, the kind unattainable unless god’s invisible hand was being put to work.

Subaru: “Or perhaps, not god, but someone’s……”

Subaru convicted, as if having anticipated that.
The rest lay, in the authenticity of this 『Book of the Dead』ーー whether what was depicted here, was truly the life of 『Natsuki Subaru』 or not. If it was depicted indeed, then what sort of a trick was behind it.
As the solemn truth, Subaru was here, alive.
If the 『Book of the Dead』 of this Subaru was truly here thenーー,

Subaru: “Am I being treated as deceased, ever since I lost my memories…… the 『Books of the Dead』 of 『Taygeta』, that Hall of Memories, is even observing the worlds I die in……?”

If that were the case, then in no way is it inconceivable that it was depicting Subaru’s 『Deaths』 in some type of form through the 『Book of the Dead』. However, in that case, what did that make of 『Return by Death』.

Subaru: “Whether it rewinds time, or does it rebuild the world itself, I had given a thought to both but……”

For the argument’s sake, in the case that the 『Books of the Dead』 assumed a method to generate the book of 『Natsuki Subaru』, it could not be helped but to reach the conviction that the latter had much more likelihood. If that holds true, then the phenomenon which encased this Natsuki Subaru was not something as charming as 『Return by Death』 butーー,

Subaru: “Am I, an idiot. No, I am an idiot…… Damn, coward.”

Sensing his contemplation disarray into a slant, Subaru abused himself.
Why his thoughts had gone astray, he understood the reason for that by immediately noticing his own cowardice. ーーHe was merely, frightened of the 『Book of the Dead』.

What would happen when he would read the book of 『Natsuki Subaru』.

He was frightened, of that happening whose course was completely unfathomable. That is why, pursuing the hypothesis lacking all foundation, he was trying to delay it and keep delaying it.
Of opening up the first page, of the book within his hands.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

Though it was not a hypothesis which came into being merely five minutes ago or anything, the fact that the 『Book of the Dead』 of 『Natsuki Subaru』 was present here was strange, but for Subaru, it was also salvation.
Subaru also considered the evidence that it had not popped up and appeared at just this instant.
However, along with that, it also held the meaning that a 『Natsuki Subaru』 other than himself, had certainly existed and had walked his own path in this different world, and also that Subaru was trampling upon those footsteps from above, laying waste to them, and painting them out.
That is why, all that was left was to gain confirmation.

Subaru: “First of all, as the 『Book of the Dead』 of 『Natsuki Subaru』…… where does this thing start from, and where does it end at?”

At Meili’s instance, precisely from her infancy onwardsーー ever since she gained awareness of ■, ever since her memories had been established as memories, even her half death was able to be followed up to.
However, how would things unfold in Subaru’s case. ーーHaving read the 『Book of the Dead』, it originated with sprouting as self-consciousness identical to that of Meili, facing growth over time, and finally, where it all came to an end.

If 『Natsuki Subaru』 is being counted as deceased instead of the present Natsuki Subaru who lost his memories, to follow up to 『Natsuki Subaru’s』 memories till the moment immediately preceding the loss of memories, would be natural, or perhaps not.

Instead, perhaps it would follow up to the memories of the present Subaru, who had lost his memories, and awakened inside the tower. In that scenario, which 『Death』 would it choose for the end.
Otherwise, as Reid’s 『Book of the Dead』, what would merely be present would be a wreckage of memories turned void.

Just as the memories of Reid, which had been recorded in the 『Book of the Dead』, had disappeared from within the book in order to reconstruct him as the trial taker of this tower, the memories of 『Natsuki Subaru』 had also possibly disappeared.
That is why, what would be visible after opening this book would not be the memories of 『Natsuki Subaru』, butーー,

Subaru: “ーーIn the end, what do you want to do, cowardly bastard.”

Does he desire to see it, does he desire not to see it.
Disdaining his own self, who had been unable to easily respond to that, reprimanding the fearfully curled up ■, he exhaled.
After coming this far, it was inconceivable to opt for not seeing it. Even if it had risen to the surface as an option, he could not even envisage the lunacy of choosing it.

That is why, that is why, that is why, that is why, that is whyーー,
And then, and then, and then, and then, and thenーー,

Subaru: “ーー~hk.”

Taking a powerful breath in, he opened up, the 『Book of the Dead』.
And, the journey of 『Natsuki Subaru』, of an unknown origin and an unknown terminationーー.
△▼△▼△▼△

ーーThis is seriously bad.

Tasting a solid sensation on his face, his brain was being scorched by the flaming heat in his abdomen.
Violent fever which restricted even his breathing, his head felt hot as if magma had been poured into his blood vessels. Yet his limbs turned colder and heavier, the inconsistent sensations jolting his existence down to the very soul itself.

His thoughts screamed about what had occurred. His thoughts screamed that he must do something.
With those flowing in and intertwining, he gave rise to a screech.

However, his consciousness, which was screaming he must do something, proved to be futile.
The moment he moved his hands in an attempt to break out of the deadlock, and touched his guts, which were the origin of the scorching heat, his palm was drenched wet with thick blood, and he understood that further blood also had the floor drenched.

ーーAh, is all of this, my blood.

Though he was unaware of the amount of blood that had flowed on and inundated the floor, the bleeding had not been of the level of blood donation and so forth. The source of his life streaming out, did not put a halt to the fragile lamp of life.
In short, his flesh body had already commenced the countdown to death.

Even still, the reason why ■ had not died yet, was because for this life of his, which was heading towards its death, there yet remained a mission to fulfill.

ーーHe had, to raise his voice.

He must raise his voice.
Watch out. It’s dangerous. Don’t come here. Run. Without turning back even once, run at full speed.

And, he must inform about the hazard.
He must convey it to her, inform her about danger, so that she does not enter this place.

And yetーー,

“ーーーー”

He was unable to raise his voice.
What spilled out instead, was the nauseating warm blood clot. With his throat clogged by that, he was rendered incapable of bringing out even a single uncouth word. Violently coughing, the scorching heat in his abdomen expanded.
Ache and agony, misery and disorder, andーー,

“ーーbaru?”

The tone of the silver bell’s voice, eventually took a step into the space it must not enter.

“ーーーー”

He had to stop that, no matter what.
And yet, he did not make it.
Though he had to do that even if it meant selling his life away for it, just because his guts had gotten lacerated.

“ーー~hk!”

A scream echoed, someone collapsed down onto the floor along with a violent report.
The hand of that fallen someone, overlapping with hand of his fallen self, was an offensive prank on part of the far too ironic fate. In all ways, the wickedness of the one known as fate was far too onerous to describe with words.

“ーーーー”

Those weakly trembling fingers, softly grasped that overlapping hand. Grasping back that sensation of fingers, as if they were clinging and relying upon, Subaru deeply, deeply, along with that clump of blood, inhaled.

“……ait.”

The overflowing clot of blood, the seeping and streaming away life. He could not, stop that outward flow of blood.

No longer, could he do anything. This situation, had reached its absolute limits.
All due to a single powerless, incompetent man, everything was going to start afresh.

That is why, his vow dyed with this blood, wielded no significance.
Even though he knew nothing could be done, his idiocy yet commanded him to vow.

Even though he knew it was over.
Even though he knew it will be over.
As if those were not coming to an end, disgracefully, he vowed.

“I will, for sureーー”

ーーSave, you.

At the next instant, heーー Natsuki Subaru 『Natsuki Subaru』 『Natsuki Subaru』 lost his life.

△▼△▼△▼△
The moment the connection was severed, Subaru sensed firm pain at the back of his head.

Subaru: “Gahーー ~hk.”

The impact reverberating in his skull, he hallucinated as if he had been suddenly struck from behind, but he immediately understood that he was mistaken. Because, Subaru’s body had collapsed right behind, and he could feel the entirety of his back make contact with the chilling floor.

Subaru: “This, place is……”

Icy and dim, not in the soiled building, but he was in the library of 『Taygeta』.
Slowly pouring energy back into his body, turning about his dumbfounded head, Subaru turned his neck aroundーー and then, touched his own guts with great perplexity.
There supposed to be present, was the wound which would diminish his life.
Howeverーー,

Subaru: “Not, there…… not there, not there, the wound is, not there. The slash, in the guts, is not there…… ~hk.”

Touching his guts countless times, he confirmed the disappearance of the origin of scorching heat. Within the spectacle he had witnessed immediately previously, that utmost vivid sensation was vanishing.
He had heard that the brain hallucinates ache far too scorchingly hot as a “fever”. A phenomenon identical to what had occurred. In other wordsーー,

Subaru: “ーーA memory, of having the guts be slashed open, and dying.”

The end of having the guts cut open by a sharp edged tool, drowning in the foam of blood and powerlessness, and dying.
Finally, if he himself had alone been the one to die by that, it was still excusable. However, that was not how it had been.

Subaru: “Satella……”

What he whispered, at the very end of the end, the girl he had been unable to save, her nameーー her alias.
Within that memory, the silver-haired young girl he recognised had fabricated her name and come in contact with Subaru. What had been the reason behind that. Though it was evident no evil intent was the reason for it.

Subaru: “……Still, dying such an uncouth way.”

Putting his hand on his forehead, Subaru ruminated about what had occurred to his own body.
Summoned to the different world, wandering aimlessly in the town with foolish positivity, picking up a quarrel with delinquents and almost dying, saved by Satella from that, and assisting her in her search for what she was looking forーー,

Subaru: “Completely useless……”

At the final moment, without even conveying the crisis he was supposed to convey, he ended up having her get involved as well.
Not just dying wastefully, the word vain in the expression dying in vain could not even make for an excuse.
The life of Natsuki Subaruーー 『Natsuki Subaru』 could never compensate for it.

Subaru: “But.”

It was not as if he had gained absolutely nothing from it.

Subaru: “ーーThis was, the 『Book of the Dead』 of 『Natsuki Subaru』.”

That alone was the certain, absolute, unquestionable truth.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

Hopeless, foolish, weak, irredeemable 『Natsuki Subaru』.
He continued to enlarge his absurd self-consciousness, overlapping with that, averted his eyes away from his lack of filial piety. And finally, using being summoned into the different world as a convenient means of escaping, and by exhibiting pessimistic positivity, he became a swindler trying deceive himself, those around him, anything and everything.

The result of that idiocy, had tied together with the tragedy in that loot storehouse.

What a pretentious, naive, and foolish failure had it been.
How come, could he stay defenseless at that hazardous place. What gave your idiotic self such baseless confidence. Like that, it would not be odd to get killed overseas, let alone in a different world. That lack of vigilance was to blame. The result of it all, must be that.

It had been so unsightly, such that he would have wanted to kill himself had he survived.

Subaru: “That hopeless, idiotic bastard…… but.”

Evidently, it had been fatal foolishness, but it was fortuitous to have it affirmed.
Putting a check on his rage, enduring it, he scrutinized that truth closely.

The 『Book of the Dead』 was certainly functioning. That book had recorded the death of 『Natsuki Subaru』. And, it thrust a great number of truths, which were a matter of course for 『Natsuki Subaru』, at Natsuki Subaru, for whom there was no way to know them.

ーーTo name it specifically, it was the sequence of events of obtaining 『Return by Death』.
As per convention, an existence who was god, or wielded similar strength, normally in a transcendental state of being, summoned Subaru to the different world.
However, for that 『Natsuki Subaru』, if he were to not have the memories of being summoned by such a transcendental being, there would be no occasion where he would get to know whom he got the power granted to him from and how he grew conscious of that power.
That was something Subaru could affirm, who had seen the end of that 『Natsuki Subaru』 for himself.

At the very end of the end, though he had been blabbering things without knowing when to give up, at that moment, 『Natsuki Subaru』 was supposed to not have any confirmation that he would overcome death, and rewind time.
At the very least, he himself had been like that. ーーThinking that far, he abruptly noticed.

That he, and 『Natsuki Subaru』, had not been objected well visually.
The reason for that, evident.

Subaru: “It’s diving more deeply in, than on, Meili’s instance……”

When he had read Meili’s 『Book of the Dead』, and personally experienced her life, he had tasted the sensation of having his mind undergo influence quite severely as well. Halfway melting together with her personality, Meili appeared within his mind as a symptom of hallucination, such that she said all what she wanted to say, and was toying around with Subaru.
Above all, that had ultimately been a Meili fabricated by Subaru’s consciousness, utterly unrelated to the real Meili, an illusion brought forth by chaos, he was aware of that.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

However, this instance’s 『Book of the Dead』 demarcated a line between itself and Meili’s experience.
All things said and done, in the chaos immediately after reading Meili’s book, still present were clues to differentiate between himself and her. The difference in gender, the difference in age, the difference in values, there were plenty.
Detaching himself from her through those clues, even if slightly, it was a possibility to withdraw the comprehension that she was an entirely different existence.

However, that was not how it was this time.
None other than he himself was the party concerned. His self who was not himself, a situation which normally would not manifest, it layed expectation upon Natsuki Subaru, and pushed him into his fight with himself.

His fight with himself. ーーJudging by mere words, those were not words too cliché, but they were words which evidently and straightforwardly denoted the situation which Subaru​ had currently been placed in.

The truth is, he possessed a negative outlook.
Overlapping with his self, rather meant an act of painting his self out. The water washed by the dark paint called 『Natsuki Subaru』, dyed him as if with a paintbrush that had been dipped in that.

Subaru: “ーーEmilia. Emilia, Emilia, Emilia, Emilia, Emilia.”

At the sensation of feeling himself be painted out, Subaru called Emilia’s name, as if it were some magic.
The reason why he chanted Emilia, that reason was evident. The 『Natsuki Subaru』 inside the 『Book of the Dead』, did not recognise her as Emilia.
Trusting the alias he had been told, he saw through his duties as a buffoon till the very end of the end.
That is why, that was the difference between the present Subaru, and 『Natsuki Subaru』.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

With the roots of his teeth quivering, fearing the sensation of his self being whittled, Subaru looked at his feet. The single book he had dropped thoughtlessly, that had fallen there.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

He continued to observe, such that 『Natsuki Subaru』 would have died.
If considered now, mysteriously​ enough, the 『Book of the Dead』 commenced from the moment he arrived into the different world, from when he had shouted out the change of worlds with a foolishly bare expression. Even though for Meili’s instance, it had properly commenced since she gained the awareness of ■ーー no, for now, all that was of no significance.

The problem was, the continuation to that 『Book of the Dead』.

Subaru: “You must be thinking, the same, “Natsuki Subaru”……”

Thanks to the 『Book of the Dead』, he was able to witness what was perhaps the 『Death』 of 『Natsuki Subaru』 when he was first summoned into the different world for himself.
However, that was merely the beginning.
That 『Natsuki Subaru』, must have also utilised the power of 『Return by Death』.
Otherwise, that may have been a power which had manifested not in the form of 『Return by Death』 but something further different. ーーNo, that was the natural state of affairs.

Rewinding time at will, that was much more convincing.
For 『Natsuki Subaru』, who was met by Emilia, Beatrice, Ram, Echidna, Julius, Meili, Shaula, Patrasche, Gyan, and was expected to play an active role, something like that was much more suitable. 
In that caseーー,

Subaru: “That must be there, ahead of this……”

『Natsuki Subaru』, who seemed to be no different from Natsuki Subaru.
However, there present was something decisive which caused that 『Natsuki Subaru』 to be 『Natsuki Subaru』. Seeking that, Subaru, at once, held the book in his hands.
And, closing his eyes, took deep breaths.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

With the book in his hands, Subaru counted the beating of his chest. And while calming his ■ down, he slowly commenced walking.
A slow gait, however, straightforward, lacking all faltering.
Before long, where Subaru had reached was in front of the bookshelf, and as he stretched his hand outーー,

Subaru: “ーーSecond book.”

The single book following 『Natsuki Subaru』, made a weak assertion of itself through 『Cor Leonis』.

△ ▼ △ ▼ △ ▼
ーーThe progress 『Natsuki Subaru』 made, was unsightly, haphazard, irredeemable.

“Completely useless. A novice as per appearance, with crude movements. Neither with any Divine Protections nor with any skills, imagined that there would at least be some instinct or intelligence, but not even that. Just, why must you challenge.”

Tormented by the self-indulging mighty enemy, he was minced without being able to even launch a proper counterattack.
And in the environs of his wounded self, was a bloodstained old man and a golden-haired girl, collapsed. Neither of them could be saved. He could not even move.

“Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly​, agonize.”

Before long, with his guts sliced, with his eyes sliced, within the world where he lost his eyesight, with a time limit running against his life, he lived the time until his death nestling close with dismay.
Until the very end of the​ end, all whilst fearing, shivering, dreading, disgracefullyーー,
△ ▼ △ ▼ △ ▼

“Hey, did you get stabbed.”

“It can’t be helped, you know. Try running outside. It’s more than just difficult.”

“A~h, this won’t do. If the insides of the guts get wounded then it’s death for sure…… The clothes are all a mess too.”

Fallen with the opponent overhead of him, did he truly intend to make such heedless dialogue.
He must use his brain for such worthless thoughts, otherwise he would be rendered unable to comprehend the shocking pain piercing through his back.
A technique to escape pain, or a method to protect himself, to have possession of them would have astonished him to the bottom of his ■.

He was unable to save himself, from the truly futile, vain death.
Calling the girl Satella while she was not Satella, having to hear harsh words from her due to that, unable to sense the strikingly obvious situation, killed by the opponent whom he already had tasted before abandoning thought.
A suitable end. Why, from the beginning to the end, could he not live without regretting even for a second, even for a minute.

Enough. This world was going to end. He knew it.
Because from the very beginning, he knew and could see 『Death』, and henceforth came here. That is why, if there was not something decisive present, it was the end of this world. As it is the end, as it is the end, go to the next one. Go to the next, to the next, to the next, to the next, to the next, to the next. Otherwise, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts and it hurts and it’s painful and it’s unbearably hurtful but something must be carried on to the nextーー.
△▼△▼△▼△

The demise that was brought to him whilst he was asleep, contrary to a swift and easy end, was accompanied with mercilessness as if chilling venom was poured into his blood vessels.
The arrival of the 『Death』 whereby he couldn’t even comprehend he had died, compared to the 『Deaths』 till now in which he was unable to detach pain and suffering from himself, was perhaps the easiest one is what he believed. 
However, in no way was that true.

Why, did he die. First of all, did he really die.
Within humans fearful of 『Death』, the wish to die as if sleeping is substantially present, but if Subaru, who had experienced that, were to be asked, then he would respond that it was not worth wishing for.

In 『Death』, there lies the meaning of 『Death』.

In the demise, denouement of life, something which is learnt from it must be attached to the end.
Within chaos and despair, fright and yearning, Subaru sought the subsequent 『Book of the Dead』. He must unravel what had occurred. He must unravel, what had killed his selfーー.
△▼△▼△▼△

ーーMysteries invited further mysteries, as incomprehensible and irrational 『Deaths』 followed him.

Overlapping ends, continual tragedies.
Though he had refused dying as if sleeping, dying as if being shattered, as if being gouged out, were indeed not pleasant either.

From next to next, his life was aimed for, robbed, shattered, and finally, betrayed.

Why, was no longer the question for that.
Why, must he have to save the blue-haired girl, who had killed his self.

Why, did his self become so frantic in order to save her, why, did she give such a powerful push to Subaru’s back, who was crushed and knelt down.
Why, did he gain strength by her words, and resolve to move forward.

Ahead of betrayal, he earnestly yearned.
For the desire which had actually not been betrayed, for the world which affirmed that it was correct.

『Natsuki Subaru』, offered his life as indemnification for the sake of the fruitless, sorrowful misunderstanding of saving someone, and prized it open through sheer strength.

Meeting Emilia, meeting Puck, meeting Felt, meeting Grandpa Rom, meeting Reinhardt, meeting Elsa, meeting Beatrice, meeting Ram, meeting Rem, meeting Roswaal, meeting Petra, meeting the residents of Arlarm villageーー,

ーーNo matter what, he will thrust refusal at any muddy stream that may advance upon them, is what he believed.
△▼△▼△▼△

Subaru: “Ugh, bhu…… ~hk.”

Putting a check on his lips, facing assailing death once again, Subaru knelt down in the library of 『Taygeta』. Without supporting his body, he collapsed onto the bare ground as if falling.

Subaru: “Hah, hah……”

His breath was rough, what drenched the entirety of his body was abundant cold sweat.
Whether it was hot, whether it was cold, whether it was bitter, whether it was sweet, whether it was agonizing, whether it was pleasant, his feelings were blended into a heterogeneous mixture of likes and dislikes, black and white, and he was unable to comprehend the correct answer.
It felt as if he was being struck from all angles and directions ceaselessly, from next to next.

Subaru: “……With this, eight books.”

Discovering the 『Books of the Dead』 of 『Natsuki Subaru』, and ever since he commenced reading them, he was merely piling up the number of books.
To say the number of books, was something odd in itself as well. Not that the numbering kept on ascending, originally, to have the “next book of the same series” for a book present in this library was not how it was supposed to be.

Yet, the books of 『Natsuki Subaru』 kept on piling up the number of books readily, and continued.
Adding to the mystery, the structure of not being able to find the next book of 『Natsuki Subaru』 unless the first book of 『Natsuki Subaru』 was readーー it all commenced orderly.
Without skipping a single 『Death』 for the purpose of an interval, he followed the footsteps of 『Natsuki Subaru』.

And, whilst following the footsteps, he thought.
About how tactlessly frank, incorrigible, immature 『Natsuki Subaru』 was.

Particularly the last book, observing the fate of the eighth 『Book of the Dead』, it was impossible to not feel that way.
Immediately after the announcement of the royal election, fracturing his relationship with Emilia, ultimately, merely hurting her ■ simply because he could, without any apology or retrospection, dying within the chaos was 『Natsuki Subaru』.

His self who was reading the books, sunk with his consciousness equivalent with the subjectivity of the 『Book of the Dead』.
Merely the people concerned were supposed to particularly experience that effect, but it was still difficult to tolerate.

His self, who thought why did he not understand, was present.
On the other hand was his self, who thought why did he lament by not understanding through that, as well.

Subaru: “Don’t be trapped, in the past……”

It was a tragedy he had witnessed with these eyes an instant ago, that is why, his body ached as if being torn off.
However, that was the past. At maximum, a happening that had occurred in the past.

Even if it was a happening right in front of the eyes for 『Natsuki Subaru』, who faced 『Death』 at that instant.
Even if it was a happening right in front of the eyes for Subaru, who was in agreement with 『Natsuki Subaru』, who faced that instant.

That was the past.
Persisting by turning into a wound difficult to forget, it was the past.
That is why, at the present instant, take a breather and escape the impact. Forget it. That someone, killed Emilia. That someone, committed that terrible spectacle in the village.

If not, then ■ would get shattered.

What would he do, should Subaru’s ■ shatter here, rendered unable to stand up.
How would someone, do something. 『Natsuki Subaru』 was not present here. That is why, there was no other choice but for Subaru to somehow manage through.

Subaru: “Not, yet……”

ーーHas it been found.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

There was supposed to be something decisive existing, bestowed only upon 『Natsuki Subaru』.
It would be the key to precisely distinguish between Natsuki Subaru, and 『Natsuki Subaru』. At the very least, until that key was procured, this voyage of going through 『Books of the Dead』 shall not terminate.

The decisive key, which made Natsuki Subaru grow wings and attain flight, as 『Natsuki Subaru』.
The key which changed him into the saviour who could catch Emilia, Beatrice, Rem, Ram, Echidna, Julius, Meili, Shaula, Patrasche, Gyan, from falling.

At the current instant, there were no signs of it.
『Natsuki Subaru』 could not possibly possess the mettle, the magnanimity, to be a saviour or a hero, to be able to fulfill the immense duty of saving someone.
What he possessed was merely standing out stubbornness, and the good fortune of being blessed by the people around him.
However, that was not all.

It was not that formless “something”.
He possessed the omnipotent key, something which was further apparent, evident, which could be recognised at a single glance, which convinced everyone that he had the ability because he possessed that.
He possessed it. That is why, seeking thatーー,

Subaru: “ーーNumber, nine.”

Once again he tackled, the samsara of 『Death』, whirling with mayhem and chaos, betrayal and despair.
His wish, 『Natsuki Subaru』. To turn into you, as fast as possible.

ーーBefore I, am no longer able to bear with your footsteps, your wounds, 『Death』, in my ■.

△▼△▼△▼△

ーー『Deaths』, were accumulated relentlessly.
ーーEnds, were relentlessly accumulated.

Each time he felt ache, each time he was in agony, each time he lost something, each time he was robbed of something, he heard the sound of ■ cracking.
Crying and screaming why and how, gritting his molars thinking it ends here, standing up whilst vomiting blood, sheathed in wounds, he advanced.

The struggle of an uncouth man risking his life, was present there.
Not once but twice, not twice but thrice, not thrice but four times and so forth, getting cornered by situations and expiring, yet, he held his ground in order to smash through the lock of turmoil.

That was amazing. Plenty amazing. Truly worthy of respect.
To not give up, that was something quite amazing. Even after experiencing so much, gritting teeth so much, to fight to the bitter end was amazing. Truly admirable. Improved opinions. ーーBut, that was not it.

But, that was not it. That was not it. That was not it. That was not it indeed.

Subaru: “Something was…… ~hk.”

ーー”Something” was, supposed to have happened, isn’t it.

“Something” must have happened. Otherwise, it would not make sense. Otherwise, things would not hold true.
“Something” happened, which made the impotent, irremediable Natsuki Subaru develop wings, attain flight and turn into 『Natsuki Subaru』, who could save everyone​, someone, Emilia and the others, that was how it was supposed to be.

That was why, he was searching for it, dying, losing sanity, with bloodshot eyes.

Upon each instance of reading the 『Books of the Dead』, personally experiencing the impact, terror, and the agony of 『Death』 which 『Natsuki​ Subaru』 had to taste by trifling with the altering situations, he grew further desperate and pursued his search.
Yet, he was unable to find a single clueーー,

Subaru: “Ugh, a~a~a~a~a~ーー ~hk ~hk!!”

He struck his head onto the floor.
It was alright when he was in the midst of witnessing it. However, the instant he returned, his ■ was fomented with disgrace.

Subaru: “Dad…… mom…… ~hk.”

There had been 『Natsuki Subaru』, who exchanged words with his father and mother, and apologized to the two of them.
There had been 『Natsuki Subaru』, who was thrown into the different world, and for the sake of residing in this place, bid farewell to those two.
Even after carelessly forgetting what all his self had committed, knowingly of the fact that his parents would be saddened, conveying words of love for self-satisfactionーー.

Subaru: “Ugh, bhu, e~e~e~gh.”

He vomited. His tears, overflowing.
What was hurtful, what was excruciating, was that he was painfully aware of the feelings of 『Natsuki Subaru』, and the fact that Subaru also got to know, that his parents forgave it.

Please don’t forgive. Please curse. He wished his parents would speak ill of him, call him out for lacking filial piety.

However, they did not act that way.
Neither his father nor his mother, be as per Subaru’s​ wishes. In order to console himself, he wished his parents to call him a petty human or things similar. He was unable to achieve that.
Subaru’s father, Kenichi. Subaru’s mother, Naoko. ーーThey were the greatest couple of parents.

There had been his self, who was happy for that, there had been his self, who approved of the judgement 『Natsuki Subaru』 took, despite lacking all rights to be saved, there had been his self, who was going to be saved, making his ■ unsightly.

ーーThis. Was this the source for it? With this being the reason, did he turn into 『Natsuki Subaru』. 

Subaru: “No…… no, no, no! That’s not it! Not something like, this!”

Scratching his head violently, striking his aching eyebrows with his fist, Subaru disparaged his own self.
What Subaru sought, was not spiritual salvation. What he sought was a key, ーーa power further evident, which was established in terms of proper efficacy.

The power which Subaru was ignorant of, which only 『Natsuki Subaru』 was cognizant of.

Just as Subaru had succeeded in the manifestation of 『Cor Leonis』, the special “something” which only 『Natsuki Subaru』 had awakened, that, that was.

Subaru: “The key to change this situation, I have to believe it is, or……”

The laceration of his guts, which had been the very last cause of his death from the present moment, touching the wound he was supposed to have from that, Subaru whispered.
His memories, started to overlap with what he had witnessed in Meili’s​ 『Book of the Dead』. The assault on the mansion, Meili’s both beloved and troublesome elder sister, Elsa’s attack. A natural enemy for 『Natsuki Subaru』.

However​, that was all about a world where everything came to an end.
That was all about a world which 『Natsuki Subaru』 already surmounted.

What was crucial, was not sympathising with 『Natsuki Subaru』. But unveiling, and obtaining, the deception only he was supposed to possess, which only he was using.
For that, only for that, read the 『Books of the Dead』.


ーーBecause only for that, Natsuki Subaru had been dying and redoing his actions.


Subaru: “Please tell me, 『Natsuki Subaru』! ーーHow are you special! How can only you, stay being special! There must be “something”, right!?”

Subaru: “”Something”, must have changed you! “Something”, must have rid you of your uselessness, and turned you into someone else!”

Subaru: “Please change my weak, pathetic, petty self who can’t be useful for shit! I’m fed up now! I can’t see everyone suffering, not anymore!”

Subaru: “”Something”…… “something”! Is there, right!? If “something” isn’t there then, it doesn’t make sense…… “something”, happened…… that’s why, you are…… different from, me…… it has to be that way……”

ーーIt has to be that way, or he will be rendered incapable of doing anything, but to simply watch.

Subaru: “You were, the same as me, weak, petty, completely powerless……”

ーーKneeling down time and time again, and on each instance having someone give a push to his back, as he wanted to recompense everyone who acted courteously towards him, as they had acted kindly towards him, he wanted to pay them back. 

Subaru: “Please, 『Natsuki Subaru』. I request you. Please, just stop……”

ーーIt would have had been much, much better, had he been a superhuman.
ーーHe wished for him to be an existence completely​ dissimilar to his self, one who had transcended above weakness with both his ■ and body.

ーーThat is why, he wished to be convinced by him that he had done, what his self could never achieve.

And yetーー.

Drawing books out as if plucking berries, having his head struck by continually stockpiling 『Death』, all whilst having ■ shatter upon each instance of that, eagerly, earnestly, as if sipping mud, he ate into his life.
But still, until the very end of the end, he did not cast aside the possibility he clung ontoーー.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

He opened up, the book he had in his grasp.
With the preparedness of his brain tissues being churned, his ■ being violated, his soul being humiliated, he opened it up.
After all, it was far more painful to have the very last hope severed rather than feeling ache or anguish.

Subaru: “You get it, right, 『Natsuki Subaru』……”

As if, seemingly seeking consent, he called out to the person concerned who was not in presence here.
The tone of that voice, felt as if it had sustained a terrible loss of ambition, it could not be helped.

After all, the person concerned was not someone to be enthusiastic about.
He was not, that great of a man. ーーWhilst wishing for that to not happen, his fingers as if pulling a rope, he started to draw the 『Book of the Dead』 out.
And, what will follow will certainly be the finishing blow, harbouring such feelingsーー,

???: “ーーYeah, I get it.”

Subaru: “ーーーー”

A white, white world.
Upon noticing, Subaru was not in the library, nor a shapeless existence overlapping with memories, but had been sent a place which he recognised, which was not here.
Thereーー,

???: “I get it, Natsuki Subaru.”

Subaru: “ーーーー”

???: “After all, because you are me, you know.”

Standing still within the white world, sanpaku eyes he was well acquainted with, had been awaiting Subaru.

"
Chapter 74,“Natsuki Subaru”,"Short, black hair, legs with the same length as his upper body, sanpaku eyes enough to kill someone.
Those almost unpleasantly familiar features no matter which one was to be chosen, were overlooking Natsuki Subaru whilst sitting on the white, bare ground.
Subaru: “ーーーー”
Astounded, fixedly, he gazed a deep stare into the opposing person’s face.
No matter which angle he looked at it from, it was a face he was acquainted withーー no, it looked slightly different. That was perhaps because it was, in a true sense, not the form he was accustomed to seeing.
That which he had grown accustomed to looking at ordinarily, on overwhelmingly​ multiple occasions, was something reflected upon mirrors or the surface of water. Strictly speaking, the human face was not perfectly symmetrical on both halves, that alone shaped a sensitive disparity.
That is whyーー,
???: “Ah, is that so. It’s not a mirror’s reflection so it feels a bit awkward, huh. In that sense, this is probably closer to imaging it as facing a photograph or a video recording, isn’t it.”
Subaru: “ーー~hk.”
???: “ーー? Ah, could it be, you thought of the same thing?”
When he slightly tightened his cheeks upon the single voice seemingly having read his mind, the opposing person precisely guessed those feelings as well.
Though ■ was flustered by even that, any response he could possibly give could neither serve as poison nor medicine. In the first place, what was essential for Subaru was not something on the likes of quick exchange of remarks.
Far greater, precisely that, the problem which seemingly jolted away everything wasーー,
???: “Once again then…… hey, sibling.”
Subaru: “ーーーー”
???: “No, sibling feels slightly faulty for an expression, huh. More accurately this’d be…… hey, another me.”
Raising a single hand, the personage greeted with a relaxed toneーー no, he was not a person so unduly distant. He was an existence such that even calling him someone close would be a half-hearted expression.
After all, because the one present there was unmistakably was, with the same face as Natsuki Subaru, none other than『Natsuki Subaru』.
Subaru: “ーー『Natsuki Subaru』.”
‘Subaru’: “……You know, doesn’t that have a strange ring to it? On top of that, calling yourself using the full name…… though, I don’t know using what else would be correct. Though it’s a situation often there in manga and stuff, it’s pretty troublesome in reality.”
Subaru: “『Natsuki Subaru』……!”
Discerning rage for『Subaru』, who piled up remarks as if talking about good weather, Subaru stood right up at that spot. And as he tried to grasp the opponent’s collars, his legs tangled instantly.
With no strength driven into his knees, his stance crumbledーー,
‘Subaru’: “Woops, watch out.”
Subaru: “ーー~hk, don’t touch me!”
『Subaru』, who was in front, caught his body which was pitching forward and falling. The moment he came in contact with those arms, Subaru experienced unbearable repugnance and shook off the opponent’s arms.
At the same pace, taking steps and distancing himself away from『Subaru』, he continued glaring at the opponent.
Subaru: “Why are, you here…… first of all, where is this place!?”
With『Subaru』within his field of vision, Subaru signalled the surrounding white world with his hands.
White space, a place with nothing, that was just as the cradle of Od Lagna where he had confronted that Sin Archbishop of『Gluttony』, Louis Arneb.
Subaru: “Shit……!”
It was a total mess inside of his mind.
In accordance with the real time that flowed within the tower, his meeting with Louis was not something which happened even a few hours ago.
However, for Subaru who had stockpiled multiple attempts pertaining to the five obstacles, it felt like an incident in the faraway, distant past.
Furthermore, Subaru had personally experienced the life and death of『Natsuki Subaru』more than twenty times through the『Books of the Dead』. Even if the contents of the『Books of the Dead』were something which felt short, running through life and death in less than five minutes, there had also been more than a year’s time where nothing had occurred.
He had tasted those successively, indulgently. Neither were there any guarantees regarding his recognition not getting​ disordered.
The passage of time was vague, on top of that, he had much awaited this meeting with the unanticipated opponent.
Subaru widened his eyes and waved his arms about violently,
Subaru: “Why, are you in this place!!”
‘Subaru’: “ーーIt is, the proof of you having caught up to me.”
Subaru: “ーーーー”
‘Subaru’: “You read the『Book of the Dead』, and caught up to me. Everything you were not aware of, you must have seen it in the form of personally experiencing it. My, life in a different world, alright.”
Subaru: “Huh.”
With an indifferent tone,『Subaru』responded to Subaru, who had depleted his breath and clamoured. Viewing that composed attitude, Subaru gritted his molars.
He was unable to stomach that conclusive expression, that attitude of seemingly knowing all, anything and everything.
ーーFirst of all, what did this man, making that odious face, say just now?
Subaru: “I, caught up to you?”
‘Subaru’: “That’s right. There’s not a single thing anymore, which you don’t know about me. That’s why……”
Subaru: “ーーDon’t, joke around ~hk!!”
‘Subaru’: “ーーーー”
Subaru: “I, caught up to you, you say? Stop kidding! Don’t lie! Not yet! I don’t know about that which is the most important, which is much more essential, yet!”
Roaring with his eyes open wide, Subaru seized hold of『Subaru’s』collars this time.
Upon that usage of brute strength,『Subaru』made no attempt to parry it. Pulling the opponent’s collars towards himself at the same pace, from a distance where both of their breaths entwined, he glared into those black eyes.
“ーーーー”
Within the dark eyes of the face which was the same as his, the instant he perceived the same face reflected within, nauseating self-hatred surged within his own self.
Whether he harboured that self-hatred for himself or for the『Himself』present before his eyes, was neither known to him nor did he even contemplate considering it.
Merely remaining at that extremely close distance, he glared at the opponent and unraveled his fangs.
Subaru: “Tell me! It’s pretty convenient you’re here! Tell me now! The reason you became yourself must be somewhere! I haven’t seen that. I haven’t found it. That is……”
‘Subaru’: “The reason I, became myself?”
Subaru: “That’s right! There must have been a cue for you, to turn into yourself! You are, you are……”
‘Subaru’: “ーーThat, must have been seen by you, no?”
With his collars seized,『Subaru』was gazing at Subaru, nonresistant.
He did not even try to repel away the arms waving him about. Subaru received that as a hallucination as if he wasn’t even doing anything.
He perceived exactly that, as being looked down onto from a higher levelーー,
Subaru: “Stop looking at me like that!”
‘Subaru’: “ーーGah ~hk.”
Aiming at that conclusive side profile, Subaru launched his fist.
The fist wielded firm impact, blowing『Subaru』off as if he had been strummed. There was no recoil, no similar pain striking back at Subaru.
The pain『Subaru』sustained, injured, was only the pain『Subaru』had sustained.
That was, not identical to what Natsuki Subaru had sustained.
Subaru: “Lining up words, as if knowing that…… is that so, I get it.”
Smacked by Subaru,『Subaru』had knelt down on his right leg. Observing him rubbing his struck cheek with the back of his hand, Subaru consented.
That opponent ahead of his eyes, who spoke with a mouth as if knowing everything, was not mistaken.
First of all, if this was the cradle of Od Lagnaーー the Hall of Memories, would that not make him the opponent he should be utmost vigilant of above all other matters
Subaru: “Are you, Louis? The Sin Archbishop of『Gluttony』! It’s you again, right!?”
‘Subaru’: “……Me?”
Subaru: “Don’t play dumb!”
Last time, Louis, whom he had encountered in the Hall of Memories, attempted to prompt segregation between Subaru and『Natsuki Subaru』, and eat that existence away from his head through one way or another.
Back then, he had managed to escape those fangs from a hair strand’s breadth worth of distance but had their nature been such that they would be willing to give up through simply that alone, they would not be called Sin Archbishops.
Just how ugly, how irredeemable the existences known as the Sin Archbishops were, he had witnessed that in its​ entirety.
Petelgeuse, Regulus, Sirius, Capella, all of them were the absolute lowest and worst of failures as personalities. Ley, Roy, and Louis were no exceptions to that either, he could especially affirm that.
What if Louis, who had been lying in wait inside of Reid’s『Book of the Dead』, was utilising some form of method and hiding in ambush within the『Book of the Dead』of『Natsuki Subaru』.
Thus, it was plausible that she had been boldly lingering and awaiting Subaru.
Subaru: “Isn’t that true,『Gluttony』! Louis Arneb! There’s no way I can be confused by you, who can change shapes and forms, like this!”
Relying upon the『Memories』and『Names』stolen from others, rather than just the opponents’ abilities but extorting even their form, and chewing and digesting them as if they were her belongings was the Authority of Louis Arneb, as well as that of her elder brothers, Ley Batenkaitos and Roy Alphard.
She had demonstrated that artifice even within the tower, lacking any regret. Nothing felt out of place should her place of demonstrating that merely have gotten changed to the Hall of Memories.
Subaru: “This time for sure, devouring me and hijacking me, is that what your plan is? Even after being rejected once, persistent little…… do you really want to『Return by Death』so much!?”
Without any vacillation, he voiced the words『Return by Death』.
He had personally experienced the memory of having to taste hellish anguish by voicing that on several instances. The penalty of having his heart be crushingly gripped accompanied with immense pain. However, it was still alright if only his self was to be the one to experience that agony. ーーCompared to the cases where it befell over Emilia, or the surroundings.
However, the penalty was not invoked for Subaru, who had shouted whilst crushing faint horror.
『Subaru』before his eyes, did not seem to have had his heart crushingly gripped at all either. In bug a single instant he understood that『Subaru』had also been relieved at the lack of the evil influence’s ingress, seemingly having been on lookout for the same. That was, infuriating.
With the same face as his, he also bore the same thoughts as him. ーーHe thought of it as an assertion that, at maximum, he and his opponent were the same.
Subaru: “ーー~hk! Just, get it already! Is this really that amazing of a power? Is this an admirable power!? It’s just dying, and redoing. Dying and redoing…… nothing more than that. If I, who uses it, am shit then the results it brings are also shit! That’s why……”
‘Subaru’: “ーーーー”
Subaru: “That’s why, I couldn’t save anyone…… I let everyone die. Because I am weak, I make everyone, miserable. Just like how, even now, nobody will get saved……!”
ーー『Return by Death』, was nothing so adequate.
It was always far better, to not have something like this be of need. Though there had been a Witch who claimed this power to be something splendid, the utmost prime and nonpareil thing in this world, he could never hold the same opinion.
Even if an ant is made to wield artillery, it can never utilise it. Ultimately, it was unsuited to it.
He was a weak, petty, lonely child who kept crying and throwing tantrums.
What the Witches in that dream tea party had stated, was correct. He was hopeless. He was weak. He could never find it. He could never use it. Both『Gluttony』and the『Witch of Greed』, who failed to comprehend that, were damned.
Just, how many times would he have to get deceived, how many times would he have to get his hope trampled underfoot, how many times would he have to get his ■ vanquished, until he learnt.
Why, after countlessly getting deceived, countlessly having his hope trampled underfoot, countlessly having his ■ vanquished, does he still think of doing it.
『Return by Death』, displayed all of the unpleasant fragments of the world.
It displayed the absurdities, the irrationalities, the destiny enough to make one avert one’s eyes.
Yet, how comeーー,
Subaru: “ーーI love, everyone.”
Without noticing, with his head hanging down, kneeling down at that very spot, Subaru shouted as if casting a curse.
And upon the disgraceful grievance similar to weeping,『Subaru』horizontally shook his head. Whilst shaking his head horizontally, for once, at this instant, he said, converging with his words.
‘Subaru’: “ーーI love everyone. That’s why, I can’t stop.”
Subaru: “ーーーー”
Erasing the tinge of red on his struck cheek with his fingers,『Subaru』stood up in Subaru’s stead.
The same attire, the same expression, possessing the same face and name,『Natsuki Subaru』, who seemed to be decisively different from his selfーー whilst that looked at Natsuki Subaru,
‘Subaru’: “The position you were put in, to be honest, even imagining its difficulty is rough. Everything completely new, starting from level 6 having the status of initial stage without the option of going back. The complaints you voice out too, I understand all of them. Because those, are wounds I have gotten to taste time and time again.”
With immense powerlessness, with immense ignorance, it was a countenance that had gotten to taste that countless times. ーーNo, he had gotten to taste that countless times.
The defeat, the agony, the grief of『Death』which『Subaru』had to taste, Subaru was aware of it all. He had witnessed it all with these eyes. He had tasted it all, with this body and ■.
Precisely because he had tasted those, precisely because he knew that was not a lie, he could not accept 『Subaru’s』 words. He did not want, to accept them.
‘Subaru’: “Had I been strong, had I been smart, had I been more, more…… it must be frustrating.”
Subaru: “Speaking as if, you understand it……! About me, what the hell do you”
‘Subaru’: “I do know. You must also be aware of what I know. It’s a pointless quarrel, actually. For both me and you.”
Subaru: “ーー~hk.”
There was no strength in his words of objection. It had been a matter of course.
An objection repels away the opponent’s words, brushes them away suggesting lack of agreement, crushingly defeating them, making the statement that you are wrong. Such an intention was essential.
Subaru of now, did not have the ability to face『Subaru』with that.
After all, he was aware of it.
He was aware that that was no lie or deceit, but the entirety of『Natsuki Subaru』.
Subaru: “I didn’t look, at your memories or anything……”
‘Subaru’: “Hey you can’t be doing this, after looking through one’s diary as per your own convenience.”
Subaru: “I didn’t look, at your memories or anything!”
Upon hearing『Subaru’s』seemingly sullen voice, Subaru powerfully clenched his fists.
Slapped, poured with jeers, yet not bending his approach of dialogue『Subaru』gave the impression of being far more mature than Subaru. Perhaps even that, was a matter of course.
After all, the truth is『Subaru』was supposed to be an year older than Subaru.
That too, having observed rich experiences in the different world and having personally experienced『Death』on multiple occasions, on top of that, having woven many bonds and acquiring the position of his current self.
But stillーー,
Subaru: “I didn’t look, at your memories or anything…… ~hk.”
Once again, once again Subaru utilised those words.
For once, right now『Subaru』said nothing to Subaru, who stockpiled the very same repentances. Subaru, without even seeking any response, resumed as if incoherently muttering.
Subaru: “I, wanted to have hopes for you. That you were an amazing guy, and that if I got to know the “something” which was supporting your amazing nature, I would be able to do the same thing too. But still……”
But still, he ended up knowing it.
He ended up witnessing, everything.
『Natsuki Subaru』had absolutely no difference from the Natsuki Subaru present here, that he was a weak and petty man, he ended up knowing that.
In the time unknown to Subaru meeting people unknown to Subaru, running past a chronicle unknown to Subaru, having witnessed a scenery unknown to Subaru, he was merely an ordinary human who had done all that.
Subaru: “ーーBy denying you, I wanted to proclaim something plausible and fulfill it.”
However, he could not do that.
Subaru: “After all, I understand your feelings. ーーBecause you, are me.”
The world『Natsuki Subaru』had witnessed, had tasted, he had viewed it.
『Natsuki Subaru』had fallen in love with this world, with the people of this world, with Emilia and everyone else and the wounds he had accepted for them to survive, he had viewed all of that.
He had been misunderstanding. He had been misapprehending.
Since it was regarding himself, it may be appropriate to say he had conceited.
The illusion of『Natsuki Subaru』being a superhuman, had been shattered and cast aside.
Subaru: “Yeah, I get it! I got it! Why you…… why you kept standing up again and again, why you never gave up after dying again and again, is because that’s all you can do!!”
Just like Subaru,『Subaru』had also gotten slammed into walls he could do nothing about on innumerable instances.
Upon each occasion of that, he died recurrently, repeatedly, stockpiling『Deaths』, amending the way he met, amending the way he connected,『Subaru』overcame hindrances.
That was all.
Subaru: “Can there be someone who won’t stand up despite Rem telling him so much to do so!? Acting conceitedly after getting knocked by Otto, I noticed that! I always knew that dad and mom, were considerate like that! I mean, they are my dad and mom, after all!”
The scenery『Natsuki Subaru』passed through, the cue essential for surmounting, not the “something” which Subaru sought but merely accumulated wishes were certainly there.
Subaru: “I love Emilia. I want her to rely on me to protect her. I want to be with her. The reason I wanted to be a knight, was so that she thought of me that way. I was happy. I want to walk outside with her without any failures, she, who is afraid of getting hated, and I want to boast around that she is someone capable of being loved by everyone! I finally had Beatrice accompany me. I want to make her happy as much as the time she had been in pain. She, has the right to be happy!”
That is whyーー,
Subaru: “ーーThe reason why you don’t give up, is just because you love everyone! Bloody bastard! Why aren’t you a superhuman! Why, are you still an idiotic brat!!”
‘Subaru’: “ーーーー”
Subaru: “Be strong like Reinhardt! Be someone who can do anything like Julius! If you can’t do that then be useful like Ferris! How about exceeding in a single thing like Wilhelm-san!? Choose even one, for you to……”
By taking time and even experiencing agony, what he realised was merely that.
That『Natsuki Subaru』was an ordinary human, that he possessed only the cards which were the same as what Subaru did, that he extremely lacked skill in properly utilising them, that neither did he have good fortune when it came to victory and defeat.
Even, a single one of just thoseーー,
Subaru: “Any single one of them……”
With a powerless voice, having forfeited all spirit, he whispered.
Any single one of them, even a single one of them, grasping tightly the hand incapable of wielding anything.
Subaru: “……You, are Louis, aren’t you.”
With a husky voice, he uttered a query unrelated to what he had said till now.
Listening to that,『Subaru』, who had remained silent for long nodded, saying “Ah”.
‘Subaru’: “No. I’m not Louis. Unfortunately, I won’t​ say even that. I’d rather not have her disturbing. You don’t need an explanation for her personality being the worst, do you?”
Subaru: “Yeah…… I guess, so.”
Responding with a meagre, feeble voice, Subaru hid his own face with his arms.
Concealing that his throat had shrivelled up due to his howling up until the previous moment, oozily, pain started to well up in his fist which had hit『Subaru』.
If this was the Hall of Memories, then Subaru’s body could not be stated to be a real entity here, is how it was supposed to be, and yet, it was absurd that he could feel pain.
ーーYes, pain,『Death』, was ever absurd and ever difficult to bear.
That was accurately why, the Sin Archbishop of『Gluttony』, Louis Arneb was mistaken.
The thought of wishing​ for that by one’s own accord, was unmistakably mistaken.
Subaru: “……Why did you, disappear.”
‘Subaru’: “Hm?”
Subaru: “Why did you vanish away. You disappeared, that caused, so many hardships……”
The impetus of the ever present incomprehension, and the origin of everything.
The reason why『Natsuki Subaru』disappeared, and Natsuki Subaru was born.
Just what happened to the body of『Natsuki Subaru』, who had disappeared alongside his memories.
Subaru: “The reason why you disappeared……”
‘Subaru’: “……That was a total miss on my part. I entered『Taygeta』with the intention of finding a way to capture Reid. Then, through the series of events, it was all great till I found Reid’s book, but……”
Subaru: “……Then, Reid’s book turned out to be empty.”
‘Subaru’: “Then I was put in the same bowl as『Gluttony』. The rest is, you probably get it even without me having to say it.”
Scratching his head,『Subaru』looked back onto his own shame.
Encountering Louis Arneb in the Hall of Memories,『Natsuki Subaru』had gotten『Memories』stolen. And, forgetting all of his life in the different world until that point, his self, of course, created Natsuki Subaru who could not apprehend the feelings of the people around him.
‘Subaru’: “Don’t depreciate yourself like that…… Would be difficult even if I tell you so, huh. After all, you are me.”
Subaru: “……『Natsuki Subaru』is a weak, petty, irredeemable huge idiot.”
‘Subaru’: “That’s not wrong.”
Subaru: “But.”
‘Subaru’: “ーー?”
Whilst making a wry smile and gesturing his agreement,『Subaru』raised his eyebrows in response to Subaru, who had whispered powerlessly.
While looking at that『Subaru』, Subaru voiced the continuance of the words he had held back.
That wasーー,
Subaru: “ーーYou are, an amazing guy,『Natsuki Subaru』.”
ーーThat was, his honest opinion lacking all exaggeration, having witnessed him『Return by Death』greater than twenty times.



△▼△▼△▼△

“ーーーー”
Whilst looking at the man before him, he steadily narrowed his eyes.
With a face he was used to looking at, with a face he was tired of looking at, a face he thought that was even was distressful to look at, it was his own self. It was his own self, it was not his own self, though it was his own self, he did not believe it to be his own self.
That face had a reaction as if having been pricked with something unanticipated for the first time, it was gratifying.
Subaru: “……The closest person, huh.”
There were not many humans who loved their own self from the bottom of their heart.
Subaru particularly belonged to that category, and Subaru hated himself. Perhaps『Natsuki Subaru』was no different in that regard either. ーーSubaru,『Subaru』, hated himself.
However, as the closest person, when Natsuki Subaru saw『Natsuki Subaru』, to say this would be exceedingly embarrassing but, so cool, was the thought that crossed his mind.
Subaru: “I respect you, who is weak, hopeless, unable to do anything, but still, continues to struggle, and loves them. That’s whyーー”
‘Subaru’: “ーーーー”
Subaru: “ーーThe meaning of me, reading your『Book of the Dead』, was there.”
He had not opened up the『Book of the Dead』merely in order to gnash his weakness, to grieve the cease of trails, to slam grudges on his self who had the same face as his own self.
Of course, neither was it to have the megalomania of following​ up to the superhuman Natsuki Subaru’s​ roots and attaining unparalleled strength, granted.
What he sought was learning that『Natsuki Subaru』was merely human, his deeds, his path.
Subaru: “……You sure are a guy, who says embarrassing stuff suddenly, you.”
『Subaru』, who had remained frozen by Subaru’s oration until then, abruptly came alive.
『Subaru』had his eyes narrowed at the ill humourーー no, in a state of feeling somewhat awkward, he sharply gazed at Subaru and slowly stretched his fingers ahead,
‘Subaru’: “It’s pretty questionable for me to say it myself, but you sure can say all that after having looked back onto my entirety up until now. Now that it’s mentioned, it’s『Natsuki Subaru Starting Life in a Different World from Zero』, you know.”
Subaru: “Ah, it feels so weird to have the leading actor’s name be the same as yourself.”
‘Subaru’: “It’s better than having the heroine have the same name as your mom, isn’t it…… No, not that.”
Unreservedly reciprocating persiflage, Subaru exchanged a gaze with『Subaru』.
『Subaru』, who somewhat seemed to have tasted an under-shoulder swing down, he pointed at himself with his hand and,
‘Subaru’: “I had said all that earlier, but is this seriously okay? The possibility of me being a fake of Louis is not supposed to have completely disappeared, you know.”
Subaru: “It has disappeared. You didn’t revert even after I seriously hit you.”
‘Subaru’: “I mean, to revert back by that is just in the case of Yanagisawa’s copy ability……”
As per『Subaru’s』objections, that could not truly be used as rationale.
However, at that point in time, Subaru had let go of his scepticism regarding『Subaru』.
The reason for that was perhaps what『Subaru』had commented earlier.
For argument’s sake, even if Louis Arneb ate away one’s life away from head to toe without sparing a single part, he believed that she would not be able to reconstruct that face, that voice.
Because she did not have the ability to comprehend blessedness, felicity, happiness.
That is whyーー,
Subaru: “She, who loved nobody, cannot understand the emotion of『Returning by Death』for the sake of someone you love.”
‘Subaru’: “ーーーー”
『Subaru』before his eyes kept silent, as Subaru took a long, painful inhale.
Now that he had voiced it out, it was terribly stale, naught but sweet nothings pleasing to hear, nothing more. Yet he had been unable to discover any other responses.
That is why the『Subaru』before his eyes was unquestionably『Natsuki Subaru』.
Subaru: “Why are you, here? Were you waiting, for me?”
He recognised the『Subaru』before his eyes to be possessing the same roots as himself.
On top of that, the doubt surfacing in his mind, was regarding the two Subaru happening upon each other here.
Upon that question of Subaru’s,『Subaru』firmly stepped on the pure white floor,
‘Subaru’: “The reason why you and I met each other here, is because this place is the sole point of contact between you and me.”
Subaru: “The point of contact, between you and me……”
‘Subaru’: “The reason me, who has『Memories』within the tower, and you, who doesn’t have『Memories』, crossed over is just because of the『Book of the Dead』of this area. Both ahead of this and before this, you and I couldn’t have met each other.”
Subaru: “ーー. On second thought, let’s go back to the first question. Why, are you here?”
Without digesting the explanation『Subaru』gave, Subaru, once again, cast the same question.
Strictly speaking, he could not comprehend the logic behind the two Subaru coming across each other here. It ended up being that『Subaru』, who possessed『Memories』, and Subaru, who did not possess『Memories』, both existed alongside each other.
ーーThe rules of the formation of a『Book of the Dead』, its intricacies were unknown.
Now that if it were to be mentioned, the book of『Natsuki Subaru』piling up the count of deaths up until now was strange in itself. Precisely that was a phenomenon which if the『Deaths』of『Natsuki Subaru』were not being observed from outside of the world, it would not come into existence.
Did that mean, that Od Lagna fulfilled the role of that observer.
Subaru: “But if that’s the case then Louis, who was in the Hall of Memories, if she had been observing『Return by Death』, I don’t know for what reason she would be in such high spirits. If she can recognise that from the outside……”
‘Subaru’: “She may be staying in the Hall of Memories, but she can’t be its ruler. It’s ruler is…… probably a guy even more nasty, I think. If you consider it from this situation.”
Subaru: “I get it when you say it’s a nasty guy. The one most plausible is……”
Halting words there for once, Subaru and『Subaru』collectively stated.
“ーーThe『Sage』Flugel.”
They called that, to be the ill-natured utmost plausible personage.
The personage who had connections to the establishment of this Pleiades Watchtower, installing a『Trial』such that Reid was placed in it, furthermore, imposing an ascetic of unknown termination upon Shaula for four hundred years.
In all honesty, Shaula was pitiable. If it would be possible, then he wanted to snatch her away from that master of her’s.
Subaru: “Then, the reason for my self, both possessing and not possessing『Memories』existing alongside is……”
‘Subaru’: “ーー. That’s the type of question difficult to find an answer for. Since I am here, and you are here”
Subaru: “That’s just how, it is, huh……?”
Whilst feeling a sense of unease, catching『Subaru’s』words, Subaru drew his chin in.
The truth is it had been the kind of question lacking a question setter. Even if theories of some kind were to be arrived at, in the end, they could never provide the answer.
If this question must be investigated thoroughly, and the answer must be found, then it wasーー,
Subaru: “As long as you truly aren’t Louis Arneb, it shouldn’t be a problem.”
‘Subaru’: “That’s a pretty bothersome way to confirm. Do you, really trust me?”
Subaru: “I trust you I trust you. If you let me hit you one more time on the other side, I’ll trust you more.”
‘Subaru’: “Is that so. I wouldn’t say it’s the best bargain, you know.”
Interchanging frivolous dialogue in a relaxed manner, Subaru shrugged his shoulders at『Subaru’s』words.
The cowardly way of conversation for delaying the core of the dialogue like this, with other people aside, but when it was used with oneself it got seen through far too easily.
That is why, Subaru took it upon himself and for the third time, fired the same question.
Subaru: “He~y, another me. ーーFor what purpose, are you here?”
‘Subaru’: “ーーーー”
Subaru: “You must also be knowing, I won’t listen to something like that.”
Upon『Subaru’s』attitude, who opted for reticence, Subaru whispered with his black eyes straitened. Even after hearing that, he did not return back persiflage similar to the one until now.
Instead of that, what levitated in『Subaru’s』black eyes was the radiance that had always been present since the beginning.
Perhaps that was, often called, what is known as, the feeling of guiltーー,
‘Subaru’: “ーーHey, what do you think will happen, in unification of memories?”
That was why, Subaru had deliberately asked that question cheerfully.

△▼△▼△▼△

“ーーIn the pattern of a conversation about this trick, what would be the normal answer, huh.”
“I have no idea. Clearly, it feels like something which has no answer to it.”
“To be honest, you seem to be the more knowledgeable one here, do you know about any rules that would be advantageous to know about which I don’t?”
“You read the book dissecting me, didn’t you. It’s as likely as not.”
“As likely as not, huh.”
“As likely as not.”
“……If you and I carelessly bump into each other and one eliminates the other, if it’s something like that, what will you do?”
“Don’t say all that. Whatever you think when you’re anxious, generally I also think the same when I’m anxious, that’s why.”
“That’s that. Then, no hard feelings no matter which one wins, hm?”
“No, I sure will be crazy bitter. And so if I’ll be bitter, then that means you’ll be bitter too.”
“Well, I guess so. That’s, probably right. Hm, pretty shallow-■ed huh.”
“What did you say?”
“Pretty shallow-■ed…… huh, is something wrong?”
“……No, I just probably misheard, I guess.”
“ーーーー”
“ーーーー”
“Ah, that’s right. There are some things you may wonder about their possibility, so there are some things I want to tell you, can I?”
“Well, since you’ve heard everything I’ve said up till now go right ahead and say anything.”
“Originally, you were more informed than me regarding this world…… though that advantage has more or less disappeared by me reading the『Book of the Dead』, there are some things that have changed a bit, you know?”
“Things that have changed?”
“After losing『Memories』, I talked to everyone, I got to know everyone…… it’s the story of『Natsuki Subaru Starting Life in a Different World from Zero』you don’t know about.”
“ーーーー”
“First up, Meili, okay. She’s a bit, in various ways, saddled with bombs upon herself so it’s rough but she understands if you talk to her so please, properly talk to her. I’m imagining Meili-senpai to be pretty angry right now.”
“Yeah, got it.”
“And then, there’s this huge scorpion wandering about inside the tower, but it’s true identity is Shaula. That makes things really dangerous but…… she’s not doing that, because she wants to. Please, help her too.”
“Yeah, got it.”
“Oh, by the way, I forgot to say this, but when I met Louis I got my back kicked hard by Rem. Back then, I didn’t remember Rem, so it was only after I read the book did I recall what kind of a girl Rem was, but…… hmm, as expected, that had been my Rem.”
“No, it’s my Rem, you know.”
“No, mine.”
“Mine.”
“ーーーー”
“ーーーー”
“Ram had said. That when the season of snowmelt arrives, things invisible will be visible and will surely show their faces…… As expected of her.”
“Yeah, I guess so.”
“About that guy Julius….. well, it’ll be fine even if I don’t say anything, isn’t it. He’s not that unreliable, that I must tell you something about him.”
“Yeah, agreed.”
“Thank you, for apologising, to dad, and mom.”
“Yeah, hm.”
“Thank you, for saving Otto, and Garfiel.”
“Yeah.”
“Thank you, for saving Petra, Frederica, and everyone from Irlarm village.”
“Yeah.”
“Thank you, for taking Beatrice out, and holding her hand.”
“ーーーー”
“Emilia……”
“ーーーー”
“Thank you, for falling in love, with Emilia. I also, love her. I really love her.”
“……Yeah, I know.”
“ーーNatsuki Subaru. You are an amazing guy, I sincerely know that, if it’s you then it’ll certainly be alright.”
“Yeah.”
“ーーーー”
“Hm…… I guess so.”
“ーーーー”


“Yeah. ーーIf it’s us, then it’ll certainly be alright.”

△▼△▼△▼△

“It’ll be alright, huh.”
“Yeah, that’s right. Yeah, it’ll be alright.”
“You, are amazing, I sincerely know that.”
“……Yeah, but, hm. I have to say, that.”
“ーーーー”

“ーーLooks like my summer vacation is, over.”



△▼△▼△▼△

With a shake of their hands, a clichéd exchange had been the finale.
Subaru: “ーーーー”
He inhaled, and exhaled.
Likely, the unification had not been conducted in an irregular form. ーーNo, by all rights, there had been no supposition of the process of unification being carried out in this place.
Subaru’s very existence, all happenings that had very much occurred, all of them had been irregular.
That is whyーー,
Subaru: “ーーーー”
Standing stock still, Subaru finally noticed the tears rivulet down his own cheeks, when they dripped down his chin and fell as droplets.
For some reason or another, he did not feel like wiping them off, as seemingly those streaming tears certainly had not been shed by Subaru, is what it appeared as.
The tears shed by someone, who was right now, steadily melting together with Subaru, within Subaru.
And, repeatedly breathing deeply, he went around the consciousness within his mind. What had been scorched within his own memories, wereーー,
Subaru: “ーー~hk.”
Suddenly, twenty『Deaths』Natsuki Subaru was unmindful of, flashed back.
All of them, told of struggling and writhing within the tower, and the numerous『Deaths』which became a part of the course of events tastedーー as if getting taken over, the visuals of all worrying sections established a connection.
They had established a connection, but.
Subaru: “Even you, are crossing over the bridge more than sufficiently, you know……!”
His other self, who had lined up words thoroughly commending Subaru. Digesting his fight in solitude and his heavy struggle for trusting his comrades, Subaru arrived to an understanding.
Certainly, it was just as what Subaru had stated. ーーI can, respect you.
With such thoughts, deep breathing as if trying to decelerate his eccentrically rapid pulsebeat, he bowed his head.
After that, Subaru raised his face, and glared towards the front.
That was, the unchanging white space.
The area of blank space resulting from the Hall of Memories, which had produced his irregular state.
The place where another Subaru had been until merely a few moments earlier, who had shaken hands with Subaru. ーーLooking down onto the petite shadow of someone crowding that space, Subaru straitened his black eyes.
Andーー,
Subaru: “So. Did you get to see what you wanted to see. ーーLouis Arneb.”
Subaru softly asked that to the one who had proceeded to read through the『Books of the Dead』and had reached this place and subsequently disappeared, Natsuki Subaruーー no, Louis Arneb.

Chapter 76,“The Hell Bearing the Name of Oneself”,"“ーーーー”
ーーWith the young girl who had experienced『Return by Death』and was sobbing with her hands on her head before his eyes, Natsuki Subaru intently stared at his own palm.
It was not as if he was feeling hurt after having been called a monster, after having been spoken ill of.
That he was crazy. That it was impossible to withstand, he agreed with those notions as well.
Subaru himself, had died countless times until now.
He was aware of something as basic as those experiences being unordinary. But he had simply gritted his teeth, and endured it.
Believing with all his heart that it would be better for him to suffer than the death of someone aside from himself, a friend or an acquaintance, people whose names and faces he did not know, his precious comrades or the people he loved.
That wasーー,
Subaru: “ーーYeah, I sure am amazing, right, Natsuki Subaru.”
Tightly clenching the fist he had been gazing, Subaru『Sang His Own Praises』from the bottom of his heart.
He had been commended, through loose-lipped logic impossible to be held true. Such words had been used as if to console oneself, or for encouraging oneself.
However, the『Singing His Own Praises』just now had been different.
The『Memories』and『Real Experience』which had observed the existence named Natsuki Subaru terribly objectively, were commending the path oneself had walked until now.
Subaru: “Dang. I’m unexpectedly a pretty big deal, huh.”
And that was something which『Natsuki Subaru』, who had lost his『Memories』and had returned to the starting point of being summoned into the different world, and ultimately reached this point after taking a deep read of the『Books of the Dead』, could also be told.
Starting from being ignorant with regards to the different world, accumulating personal experiences of『Death』sufficient to equal the single year Subaru had lived through, and had returned without letting his heart shatter into pieces, impressively.
Thanks to that, the lost『Memories』and the『Memories』thereafter had been unified.
Subaru: “Meili, Shaula, entrusted to me, and I will take responsibility for them.”
Meili, for whom murder had become a habit, and had locked herself into a dark future.
Shaula, who had been liberated from a vain wait which lasted for four hundred years, and wished to continue the blessed present.
Subaru: “Ram and Julius, both of them sure act unreasonably. For those two to be doing that, that’s quite a feat.”
Ram, who already knew the best possible option, and displayed prudence more reliable than anyone.
Julius, who had lost his own resort, yet embraced faith and still resumed holding the sword.
Subaru: “Beatrice and Echidna, I’ve really been a bother to them as well. Geez, I’m such a……”
Beatrice, who dedicatedly supported Subaru, and noticed the limits of his heart before anyone else.
Echidna, who was utmost suspicious regarding Subaru’s amnesia, and had granted him forgiveness at its extremity.
“ーーーー”
And, no matter if he lost his『Memories』, no matter how many times he redid, he ultimately returned to the path of being drawn towards you.
He wanted to do that. He must do that. He could not think of any other path.
That is how much, you areーー,
Subaru: “ーーEMT.”
With love and certain tranquility on his lips, Subaru raised his face.
And looked at Louis, who still had her face covered and was shivering.
Subaru: “Hey.”
Louis: “Eek ~hk!”
Subaru: “……You’re too scared.”
Subaru scratched his cheek with a single finger upon her being excessively frightened by a single call.
She was a young girl with an outward appearance which could unobjectionably be called young. The form of that young girl shivering in fear, desperately rejecting the world was a sight heavy to the chest. It seemed she had been endowed with something akin to fleeting fragility which would make one thoughtlessly extend a hand to her, by birth.
Surely, an attainment of the nature to undo the opponent’s vigilance and crawling into their interior. ーーThat could perhaps be, a crystal pure like a child that had been coercively refined.
That Louis Arneb, who did not know of the world, was like an innocent, pure child.
Howeverーー,
Subaru: “ーーLouis Arneb, you lose.”
ーーNatsuki Subaru shall not forgive Louis Arneb, who was sobbing like a child.
“ーーーー”
Louis widened her eyes, frozen, upon the verification of defeat that had been slammed right before her.
Whilst witnessing fear fill her eyes like ink spilled on a white sheet, Subaru’s heart yet remained peaceful like the calm at sea.
The world was not filled with problems that could be ignored simply because of not knowing. And the deeds Louis or her siblings had committed were countless inhuman and demonic atrocities.
It was not as if she did not get a chance to know. Through the『Memories』of others, she must have also had a chance to come in contact with human emotions, likes and dislikes and learn from them.
However, what she absorbed from there was not something akin to affection for others, but a further dusky, grisly desire, and the conduct of trampling upon and spitting on the effortful lives of others.
Perhaps the fault was that of her teachers. Her elder brothers, had been bad role models of her life.
However, it was her decision to never use any chance to return back from the mistaken path.
Subaru: “You may know as well if you were a part of me. But the ranks which you all…… Sin Archbishops name yourself as is common with the seven deadly sins. “Seven deadly sins” is a pretty english term for chuunibyou purveyors, but there also exist the “Seven heavenly virtues” which are something close it.”
The seven deadly sins,『Pride』『Envy』『Wrath』『Gluttony』『Sloth』『Lust』『Greed』.
And the seven heavenly virtues,『Chastity』『Humility』『Temperance』『Patience』『Diligence』『Charity』『Kindness』.
If the seven deadly sins were karma impossible to be sundered from humans as long as they live, then these were seven conventions which mustn’t be forgotten in order for humans carrying the burden of those sins to live with others.
Because they respect that, humans can live with other humans.
Subaru: “But, you all…… you, violated that.”
That is why, the Sin Archbishops, Louis Arneb had become an unforgivable great evil.
Louis: “Eek, eek, eek……”
The frightened, curled up Louis was struck with Subaru’s words and was shivering as if she had experienced agony.
The slightest effort of others, of the world connected to fear. Subaru was also aware of that sensation.
Having tasted the other-worldly sensation called『Return by Death』, in a situation of not knowing how to surmount the obstacle however much one may『Die』, even the sound of dry leaves swaying in the breeze seemed fatal to life.
Because he remembered that feeling akin to the soul being frozen, Subaru closed his eyes.
And,
Subaru: “Louis Arneb, you lose.”
“ーーーー”
Subaru: “So, recognise that and release anything and everything.”
Once again, Subaru repeated her defeat such that she could hear it herself. On top of that, he pushed a firm demand toward the young girl, who remained silent upon hearing that.
The return of Subaru’s own『Memories』was due to the chance meeting between Natsuki Subaru, who lost his memories, and Natsuki Subaru of the moment immediately previous to his memories being robbedーー since his advance through the different world was replayed in the『Books of the Dead』, he was able to restore his own memories in the from of tracing them back.
In the form of re-experiencing the stolen『Memories』by utilising the『Books of the Dead』.
And fulfilling the unification of Subaru before and after losing『Memories』, the result was the successful second advent of Natsuki Subaru.
As it’s byproduct, Louis, who had gotten into Subaru in the form of a Witch Factor, had been forced out as a foreign substance. However Subaru had witnessed with his own eyes, her self-indulgent treatment of the stolen『Memories』of freely bringing them out and peeling them off.
If that was possible then a method to save the people who had their『Memories』, their『Names』robbed would beーー,
Subaru: “If we think of doing it, then we can do anything is what you said, right. Then……”
From being conceited and bragging about her own abilities, she had even succeeded in a stunt like splitting the Witch Factor into two.
Since she had achieved that, then surely it wasn’t impossible for her to cancel out the effects of her own Authority. If that, that alone, could come true, then perhapsーー,
ーーIt would be possible to recover the people who got their『Memories』and『Name』stolen, to recover Rem.
Subaru: “Then, release all of the people you’ve eaten up until now. If you do that……”
Louis: “……Do that, then what?”
“ーーーー”
Subaru articulated powerfully, but Louis shortly intercepted that voice.
Louis remained on white floor in the posture of pulling her knees towards herself, making her long, long golden hair spreading out on the floor blanket herself, she was glaring at Subaru through the gaps of her hair.
What dwelled in her eyes, was the sole unquestionable hue of fear.
Louis: “Do that, then what?”
Repeating, Louis piled up the same question yet again.
Subaru had been caught off guard by her retort for a moment, but got a hold of himself immediately after she displayed her stance of conversation. Far better than her not talking due to fear.
He must accept the words head-on and fumble around for a compromise plan that could change the situation.
Subaru: “Release the great number of people, you have eaten. If the『Names』return, then even the honour of the people who’ve already died can be restored. The people who are alive, can even reunite with their families. If you would do that, then I will let you……”
Louis: “ーーOff the hook, you say? If we do that, then onii-san will let us off the hook? Off the hook, you say?”
His words intercepted yet again, Subaru felt daunted.
Viewing that reaction of Subaru’s, Louis said “Hah” and opened her mouth bearing sharp fangs,
Louis: “That can’t be, isn’t it! That isn’t possible!”
Energetically lifting her face, Louis shouted with a blazing glint in her eyes.
Her two eyes glaring at Subaru, they immutably remained soaked in fear, twinkling darkly.
With those dark twinkles in her eyes, Louis forcefully rocked her body back and forth,
Louis: “It isn’t! It really isn’t, it isn’t after all, it indeed isn’t, we’re telling you it isn’t, as it isn’t, as we know it isn’t, that’s why! Onii-san will not let us off the hook! Absolutely certainly! After all”
“ーーーー”
Louis: “Onii-san, destroys his enemies! Absolutely crushes them until the very end of the end! Without any exception! Completely thoroughly! Closes it with a perfect game! He can do that! Then there’s no way he wouldn’t do that! There’s no point in him not doing that!”
As if having heard a first-class joke, Louis ended her silence and let her emotions explode.
And to Subaru, Louis’ outbursting form was visible as terribly distant, minute.
Louis’ facial expression was disordered, trying to laugh, trying to be angered, trying to be doleful, and baffled by the notation of fear not present in any of those, she was perplexed and was imploring.
“ーーーー”
The gateways of all of Louis’ surging emotions, all directly connected to『Fear』.
Regardless of whether they began with delight, rage or sadness. Knowing that all would ultimately lead to『Fear』, for what should she be delighted, be enraged, be saddened.
Even if she were to believe, that conclusion led to『Fear』as well.
Subaru was more than sufficiently aware of the ingrained nature of Louis’ rejection. Cursing the entirety of the world, being flung into a storm of suspicion and distrust, becoming trapped in a sensation of being forbid into the slightest movement.
That was, the hell named oneself which Natsuki Subaru had also experienced.
What pulled Subaru out of that hopeless hell, was surely because there had been someone who held his hand, and that warmth never let go of Subaru.
That was, the silver-haired young girl who had saved Subaru’s life, his heart when he had first arrived in the different world.
That was, the dressed young girl who strived to protect Subaru when he had been betrayed by anything and everything.
That was, the blue-haired young girl who gently made Subaru realise when he sought to abandon everything.
ーーThat was, the reason why Natsuki Subaru had remained without being prisoned in hell.
“ーーーー”
That foundation of heart was not possessed by Louis Arneb, who was drowned in fear before his eyes.
That is why, she did not possess the ability to conquer『Fear』. ーーShe could never think of『Return by Death』other than being a nightmarish curse of being dragged into an inescapable hell.
Though quite a clichéd expression, humans cannot live by themselves. That is why, for her to be saved, she, who was caged in『Fear』, it was necessary for someone to extend their hand to her.
Someone offering their hand, just as Subaru had been offered once.
Howeverーー,
Subaru: “ーーI will, not save you.”
ーーSubaru shall not extend his hand, to Louis Arneb.
Louis: “ーーAh.”
Subaru: “I will, not save you. Neither will I pity you.”
Louis Arneb, the Sin Archbishop of『Gluttony』, the blasphemer of『Souls』standing in the white world.
Not matter how sweet an appearance, no matter how miserable and transient an ambience, no matter how luring an attitude of craving being sheltered by adults were she to possess, Subaru shall not forgive her.
The Sin Archbishops had committed sins difficult to forgive. ーーThat was the conclusion, Natsuki Subaru had derived.
Subaru: “I’m sure no matter what I say, it’ll never prove to be salvation for you in the first place.”
Louis: “Eek.”
Louis’ distended eyes were filled with naught but terror toward Subaru.
In this place though only Subaru could understand the fear she bore, the very reason for her fear was Subaru himself. In other words, her labyrinth couldn’t possibly be opened up.
And upon Subaru’s head-on declaration that we won’t save her, that he detested her, Louis stabbed her claws into the shapeless white world and whilst desperately distancing herself away from Subaruーー,
Louis: “We know…… we know onii-san’s ploy! We had been onii-san after all! That’s why, we know what onii-san is going to do…… however, we won’t let you ~tsu!”
Subaru: “You……”
Louis: “Return what was eaten! Absolutely never! After all, this is our lifeline! If we lose this, then onii-san will be able to kill us! As long as this isn’t returned, onii-san won’t kill us! Its the other way around, the other way around, completely the other way around! In order to not be killed by onii-san, we, cannot return this! That’s why you kno~w!!”
Howling with a loud voice, Louis turned her palm towards Subaru. Its not as if something was being fired from the fair palm held out. However, Louis’ aim materialised in a different form.
Subaru’s field of vision steadily distorted into white, a change was yielded in the『Hall of Memories』. It commenced constricting the world, having detected the presence of a foreign substance and seeking to eliminate it.
As a result, Subaru’s existence was extracted outーー,
Louis: “Enough, we don’t want to be in the same place as onii-san for even a second! Impossible in terms of physiology! Impossible in terms of life! Impossible in terms of destiny you see! That’s why, disappear! The ones who will eat onii-san, will be onii-chan and nii-sama! Either of them can do however they please! No thanks from our side!”
Louis’ decision, infuriatingly enough, was the best possible option for her.
Banishing Subaru from the『Hall of Memories』and sending him back to reality. And entrusting opposing him to her siblings Ley and Roy instead of herself.
If the Sin Archbishops of『Gluttony』could choose to share or not to share a meal, then Louis would be able to part ways from the worst platter named Natsuki Subaru. Whether her siblings would bear the same anguish as herself or not, that itself was something her current self did not know.
Subaru: “ーーGh.”
It was difficult to hold out.
With not a single thing to latch onto, and with even the ground to stand firm on becoming vague, Subaru was hopelessly the weaker side in this『Hall of Memories』.
Subaru: “If you, don’t like me doing it…… then if you settle this, by yourself……”
Louis: “We won’t go along with that ~tsu! Even if you try to make us kill you, it’s futile! You intend to take us to task through『Return by Death』! We won’t let you! Onii-chan and nii-sama, will utterly eat away onii-san! That is, the condition for our victory ~tsu!!”
Unraveling her fangs, Louis scowled at Subaru who tried to hold his ground. He could no longer oppose her will. Comprehending that, he let in a deep inhale.
Afterwards, Subaru’s black eyes directly pierced through Louisーー,
Louis: “ーーEek.”
Subaru: “If your siblings, are your final rope to rely on, then I understand. ーーI will slash that rope and make you pay. You’d better remember this, Louis Arneb.”
With a single finger pointed towards the frightened, cowering Louis, he resumed.
Subaru: “Everything distressful, everything painful, bear all of it by yourself. ーーDon’t run away, from the『Memories』.”
Humiliation and repentance, were all『Memories』necessary to shape the current oneself.
It’s entirety had become food for the human named Natsuki Subaru, and the Natsuki Subaru constructed by its entirety had reached this point after having stockpiled many a『Death』.
If Natsuki Subaru was amazing, then that was because humiliation and repentance let him be so.
Subaru: “With that being said, I don’t really want even a part of that shame.”
That was what Subaru whispered whilst being expelled out from a space to its edge, which wasn’t present in the world, with his field of vision turning white as if nothing had been there.
And, the『Hall of Memories』came untiedーー,



△▼△▼△▼△

And, within the『Hall of Memories』wherein the form of the dreadful lunatic had been erased, Louis Arneb took in a deep, deep shivering inhale, and confirmed her own pure life.
Louis: “Ah, ah, a~h……”
Her throat, shivering, her lungs, shivering, her heart, shivering, her soul, shivering.
Even Louis, who had indulged in every possible variety of『Memories』, couldn’t comprehend an existence that repulsive. What was truly frightening about that thing, was it’s inconceivable spirit.
Louis: “Wh, y……”
Whether she could remain as per ordinary, she did not know.
Louis had become a part of that thing, and prior to that had eaten that thing’s『Memories』thoroughly down to its roots. Slowly crunching the『Memories』without exception, she had masticated them.
That deed itself was roundabout, as if peeling off the layers of an onion’s skin one by one, a code of action separating that which yielded new life upon each instance of『Death』into greater than twenty sections.
Before having experienced『Return by Death』, that deed of dividing those『Memories』into several portions then eating them was something that made her heart pound with the notion of it being a new experience, but now all she found was incomprehensible fear.
In the first place, why couldn’t the『Memories』prior to the occurrence of the『Summoning Into the Different World』or whatever be robbed.
Originally, the power of the Authority of『Gluttony』was supposed to eat away all of the『Memories』of the subject until the moment of birth. Yet, what could be robbed from that thing were merely the『Memories』of this one year.
As if Od Lagna did not assess the『Memories』previous to that, abhorred them, or otherwiseーー,
???: “ーーListen listen, um, isn’t this a bit from what was supposed to be?”
Louis: “ーーーー”
Suddenly, a voice echoed in the『Hall of Memories』supposed to have been left alone, and Louis turned around, astonished. However, her doubts were immediately dispelled.
The one who stood before Louis’ line of sight, who had turned back, wasーー,
Louis: “Us……”
‘Louis’: “That’s right, us. Because we got the short end of the stick, its us who had been waiting here in vain. Which one will play the trial version of the greatest life by becoming onii-san, was the play environment properly arranged? Came here to report that, is it?”
Whilst saying so, smiling at Louis was the existence exactly the same herーー『Louis』.
Dividing the Witch Factor originally supposed to be one into two, having segregated the『Soul』despite being the same personage, in the utmost correct sense, another one of herself.
The greatest factor which made that possible must be that Louis did not fear the deterioration of her self, an existence of mere『Soul』devoid of a flesh body.
That『Louis』, who was one more of oneself, did not share that personal experience unlike Louis. That is why, Louis found the genuinely smiling form of『Louis』, to be unordinarily distant.
‘Louis’: “ーー? What happened, us. Making such an expression huh. First of all, what about onii-san? Being here means, got into this place by reading the『Book of the Dead』again, no?”
Louis: “ーーーー”
‘Louis’: “Besides, what’s with this being all crouched since earlier? Why be so curled up? Hey, hey hey, the goal was properly accomplished, right? Though we failed on this end, we were supposed to have fulfilled the role, isn’t it. Amazing amazing, got in pretty cleanly huh. Onii-san geez, didn’t take notice at all. Of the us inside of himself!”
Clasping her hands energetically,『Louis』reminisced the forbidden tryst.
Of course, unneeding of a necessity to mention it, Louis was aware of that affair.
It referred to back when the『Hall of Memories』got connected to when thinking of investigating the way of capturing the atrocious swordsman, Reid Astrea.『Louis』then once again came in contact with that thing, which had forgotten anything and everything, and had the circumstances permitted, intended to eat that thing including Louis, who was a Witch Factor.
Though it was an experiment to see if that thing’s Authority, including the integrated Witch Factor, could possibly be successfully plundered by doing that, it failed due to an unexpected hindrance.
She surely never mused having to taste a counterattack by one of the eaten『Memories』.
However, reflecting on it now, had the hindrance not entered there, then Louis might have become one with that thing by this time.
With that thingーー,
‘Louis’: “Hey hey, what happened, us! Talk about various more stuff, let us hear it! Saw it, right? Heard it, right? Scented it, right? Touched it, right? Tasted it, right? ーーNatsuki Subaru’s Authority eh!”
Louis: “ーーDon’t mention that thing’s name!!”
‘Louis’: “ーー~tsu.”
Resuming her merry words,『Louis』stretched her hand. The moment that arm attempted to touch her own shoulder, Louis shook off the arm in accompaniment of exasperation.
Violently, powerfully, with as much rejection as possible, she did, to the arm of her literal other half.
‘Louis’: “……Huh?”
Naturally, unbeknownst to the meaning behind her other half’s action, bafflement was yielded forth in『Louis’』facial expression.
However, Louis did not possess the leeway to look back onto that expression of『Louis’』. Louis hugged the shoulder『Others』had tried touching, and stepped backwards whilst shaking her head in rejection.
Louis: “No! Nonono! Don’t touch! Don’t come near!”
She was astonished, by her own cognisance.
However, it was her own sensation. It would not turn traitor, like the hell named oneself.
She comprehended.『Louis』before her eyes, who possessed the same face as herself, who had undergone the same experiences as herself.
The existence supposed to understand her『Soul』ーー at present, it was someone other for Louis.
It was unknown, what others will do. They will not protect Louis.
They could become Louis’ cause of death. Baleful enemies who would naught but kill Louis, who did not want to die.
Louis: “Don’t come! Don’t come near don’t come near don’t come near don’t come near ~tsu! Don’t come close! Don’t touch u~s!”
‘Louis’: “ーーーー”
Hugging her own body, she was unable to do anything but react in exactly the same way as when she had confronted that thing.
For Louis, who had continued moulding her self through the『Memories』of others in this space devoid of the freedom to even look at a mirror, the sense of foreignity she felt towards『Louis』, who possessed the same face as herself, was stronger than the unskillful others.
Witnessing Louis repeat denial and rejection like this,『Louis』reciprocatively shifted her gaze along with the hand that had been shaken off. And,
‘Louis’: “Huh? What’s with that.”
Pertaining to Louis’ rejective response,『Louis』clenched her hand that had been shaken off. She then looked down onto Louis with a terribly thirstful voice, biting and clanking her fangs.
‘Louis’: “What’s with that. What’s with that what’s with that, what does this mean. With what purpose, with what idea, with what plan with what thought, hey!?”
Louis: “Ee~k ~tsu.”
‘Louis’: “This is different from what was supposed to be ~tsu! What happened, us!? What’s, with that reaction! Attitude! Response!”
The rejected『Louis』enraged, closing in towards the huddled Louis. Crouching down before Louis, who knelled her throat upon the vigour,『Louis』grasped the hair of her cowering other half.
Subsequently making her raise her face through sheer force, the two with the same faces glared into each other at a distance that their breaths entangled.
‘Louis’: “It sure is strange. Strange, how strange, isn’t it strange, pretty strange, it is strange, as it’s strange, quite strange, as it’s too strange, as we’re saying it’s strange!!”
Louis: “ーーーー”
‘Louis’: “What about the strategy? The plan went well, didn’t it? The plan was to become a Factor and get inside onii-san, and put wickedness to work, wasn’t it? It was a job really well done. Onii-san was frightened, after all! Onii-san completely thought, that『Natsuki Subaru』was the closest person to him!”
Louis made no response to the plan which『Louis』recited and its progress.
The truth was, Louis and『Louis’』 plans had transitioned smoothly. Louis experienced『Return by Death』inside Subaru and stimulated the separation of Subaru and『Natsuki Subaru』by putting wickedness to work.
And whilst staying behind in the『Hall of Memories』,『Louis』shall eat Subaru who had differentiated himself from『Natsuki Subaru』and make the Authority her own belonging. A single step had remained.
And even if that had not went wellーー,
‘Louis’: “ーーNo matter how many times, tens of times, hundreds of times! The arrangement was to challenge until the Authority of『Return by Death』has been looted, isn’t it! What’s wrong after failing a bit! It’ll be fine by stealing onii-san’s『Memories』again and trying again no matter how many times it takes. Let’s mutually exchange roles and challenge, no matter how many times how many times it takes! Failures, can be recovered from!”
The one to assimilate as a Witch Factor, and the one to stand by in the『Hall of Memories』, she had intended to accomplish the complete extortion of the Authority by exchanging roles and regardless how many times it would take, without getting tired of it.
And yetーー,
‘Louis’: “ーーAnd yet, to do something like rejecting us, what happened huh!”
Louis: “NOOOOooooーー ~tsu!”
‘Louis’: “Wo, ah!”
With strength poured into the arm which had grasped her hair, Louis gave rise to a screech in agony and fear. Afterwards she shoved the chest of『Louis』who was before her eyes, making her other half rumble in pain and fall onto her back.
Mutually glaring at each other with eyes of disbelief, a painful silence fell upon the white world. And, whilst Louis remained silent,『Louis』widened her eyes and,
‘Louis’: “It can’t be…… aiming to monopolise the Authority?”
Louis: “ーーーー”
‘Louis’: “Since the Authority of『Return by Death』was obtained successfully, erasing onii-san immediately and aiming to enjoy it by oneselves? Leaving us as is, too.”
Louis: “T-That’s wrong ~tsu!”
Louis bellowed before the frozen『Louis』, who had painted a picture of repulsive misgivings in astonishment, in shock. That was not true at all. It was improbable. She had not thought in the slightest bit, to monopolise this.
Something like this, if it was possible to throw it away then she wished to throw it away. However, she could not do so.
For these were the『Memories』of nobody, but『Louis Arneb』. Oneself’s own『Memories』were impossible to be erased. Impossible to be stolen. Impossible to be taken in and out.
‘Everything distressful, everything painful, bear all of it by yourself. ーーDon’t run away, from the『Memories』.’
Louis: “Eek.”
So she had been told by that thing just previously.
What was experienced by oneself, what path was walked by oneself, could not be erased. Having certainly taken birth within Louis, that was the history of『Louis Arneb』herself.
‘Louis’: “This is no joke ~tsu! Something like this, as if it can be excused……!”
She had wanted to become happy. She had wanted to attain a joyful life that was hers alone.
However, the life solely belonging to her which she had attained in an unexpected form smashed Louis’ ■ーー『Heart』into pieces, and wounded her to an irrecoverable extent.
『Louis』was unable to comprehend, Louis fearing the wounds and abrasion of her heart.
‘Louis’: “As if we’ll let someone like you, monopolise our means to become happy!”
Louis: “That’s wrong! That’s wrong that’s wrong that’s wrong that’s wro~o~o~o~ng! That’s not it! That is not it! That’s definitely not i~t!”
‘Louis’: “As if we can believe that! We never thought, that we’d be betrayed by us. As expected of us, isn’t it, us! That’s right. We get it, we get it. Hm hm, we do get it!”
Louis: “No! Don’t get it at all! Don’t get it at all! Don’t get our feelings at all ~tsu!”
‘Louis’: “No, do get it indeed! After all, it is about us. That’s right. If it’s for the sake of becoming happy then we’d be willing to do anything, and must do anything! Joyfulness, is something which keeps on keeps on declining by the slightest thing!”
『Louis』bounced and joined her hands before her slim chest. And with a magnificent, broad smile, she directed a sidelong glance towards Louis who articulated her rejection in a tearful voice.
‘Louis’: “What if, we carelessly schemed wickedness? If that’s done to us by us, who have attained『Return by Death』, then no matter how much the struggle we can never win, isn’t it! Amazing! Really put thought into it, isn’t it!”
Louis: “Don’t want to die! We don’t want to die! Don’t want to die don’t want to die don’t want to die~e~e~e~!”
‘Louis’: “Don’t say such utterly obvious lies! Don’t want to die? Why? How come? If it’s unneeded then hand it over to us! What a filthy desire to monopolise…… can’t even think that it’s us!”
Louis: “ーーーー”
From『Louis’』words, she was repudiated being the same existence.
At that instant, Louis felt like she heard the note of something inside of her thirsting, cracking, shattering. She did know, what had been present inside of her which shattered.
Though she did not knowーー,
‘Louis’: “ーーNatsuki Subaru belongs to us. This, thieving cat.”
Despite not knowing what that thing was whatsoever, it was condescendingly called as a belonging.
Even though the only one who truly comprehended what thing was, was only herself, how arbitrary a thing to say.
ーーThe only one who truly comprehended that thing, was herself alone.
Louis: “ーーThe only one who understands Natsuki Subaru is us. This, foolish girl.”
That thing was fearsome. That thing was repulsive. That thing, was abhorrent.
That is whyーー,
‘Louis’: “ーーLet us taste it tooーー ~tsu!!”
『Louis』pounced, advancing in order to purloin the『Memories』which made Louis, Louis.
To hand that over, would resort to give the meaning of it being the『Death』of Louis Arneb.
Giving the meaning, of『Death』. ーーGiving the meaning, of the world witnessed by that thing.
Louis: “Ah, a~a~a~a~a~a~hーー ~tsu!!”
Screamed. Screamed. Screaming, screaming, screaming, she screamed.
Continuing to scream, whilst screaming, whilst resuming screaming, whilst continuing to raise a screaming voiceーー,

“ーーDon’t want to die.”

An exceedingly fierce, meaningless conflict commenced in the『Hall of Memories』.
A conflict with nobody watching, nobody interested.
Commenced, and ended. ーーA conflict, devoid of victors.


△▼△▼△▼△

???: “ーーIce Brand Arts!!”
The instant those words were fired, she tightly gripped to sensation born within her palm and swung it completely. What had been generated in her hands was a longsword shaped with ice and it’s cutting ability was far greater than that of some incomplete iron sword.
Though she had only just begun practicing the sword, moving her body was her specialty. Swinging the ice sword atop the extended line, she attempted to land a fatal blow upon her opponent whilst sealing off his routes to escape.
Howeverーー,
???: “Hahaha~! You’re doing i~t! But, this is far from too far from being enough to land, gee~z!”
???: “ーー~hk!”
The enemy, with his long hair waving about, evaded her fatal strike by seemingly crawling on the ground.
Glaring with his sharp cuspids unraveled, was the Sin Archbishop of『Gluttony』who named himself as Ley Batenkaitos.
Upon hearing the name of Sin Archbishop, something akin to dislike swelled up within her.
That was because approximately a month ago, clashing with a great number of Sin Archbishops in the Watergate City Priestella had led to a large number of settlements, as well as a large number of settlements being delayed, at any rate, led to mountain worth of grave happenings.
Plentiful emotions of sadness or bitterness had been born forth.
Their elimination or solution had yet not been achieved, that is why everyone was doing their best, and yet.
???: “Why, do you all act like this andーー!”
Ley: “Why? Why indeed? Why we wonder? Why is it why? Why must it be why we wonder? Why is it what we certainly wonde~r? Why must what be why? Why is what why is why is why eh!”
His teasing words possessed no echo of seriousness, her opponent did not intend to give a proper response.
Sensing that, she powerfully stiffened her cheeks. Being able to converse would be the best. However, should the opponent not comply with conversation, then she shall not hesitate any further.
That resolute exchange, certainly occurred with clarity during that moment.
???: “ーーIcicle Line.”
Ley: “Wow.”
Accompanying the chant, a sound of freezing space echoed from her rear. Countless ice stakes with sharp tips were born in the air, signifying they were ready to be fired.
Gazing at that, Ley’s composure, yet, remained unchanged. With no strong feelings for that, she merely commenced the offensive abiding by her frozen fighting spirit.
“ーーーー”
The count of the fired ice stakes was close to, but no greater than, a hundred.
Submerging the aisle seemingly constructed of stone, the dust of the ice which had impacted the floor, the walls, the ceiling fluttered about and the space frozen white brought immense damage upon the one who had been immensely hit.
Howeverーー,
Ley: “Sorry, onee-san. We’re tired of seeing that…… is something we won’t say, but we have seen it. See, because we are genius after a~ll, we don’t think an attack that has already been seen once will hit!”
Swinging the daggers fastened to both of his hands, Ley laughed, having outdone the terrific attack of ice.
She inhaled in astonishment, witnessing his talent and skill, and having withstood and outdone it as a matter of fact, as he stood completely unwounded. However, if he had outdone it once, then twice, thrice, if that still won’t work, then even more.
Ley: “You’re thinking you’ll be able to win if you do it a hundred times? It will not reach through even after you do it a thousand times, you know?”
???: “Then I’ll just do it ten thousand times! I won’t let you go where everyone is!”
Ley: “Ahaha ~tsu, well that sure is a large scale! Good gracious, how outrageou~s!”
Putting his hand on his forehead, Ley let out a sigh divided into disgust and irritation. Whilst viewing that, she quietly abided by her own words.
Though she had pronounced those words whilst simply going with the flow, she must abide by them.
Thus, the moment she attempted to step ahead and fulfill thatーー,
???: “ーーLey Batenkaitos!!”
“ーーーー”
From the rear echoed a voice in the aisle that was neither her’s nor Ley’s, leading her to thoughtlessly halt her feet. Upon looking back after being immediately lured by the voice, a shadow showed itself by the corner of the path and leapt into her field of her vision.
That was a black-haired youth with a somewhat nasty look of eyes. He rushed into the battlefield with a gallant expression, and was looking at Ley and herself, who were sparring in the aisle.
???: “Ah……”
Suddenly, “oh no” was the thought which surfaced in her innermost mind.
Though she must say something, a vacuum was born in her words. This was due to the various emotions which overflowed in face of the rushing youth.
However, before『Bafflement』was yielded in front of the youth, she hurriedly moved her lips,
???: “Its dangerous so wait! Um, you may not, know about me, but he is the enemy! Leave this place to me! Even though you may not, know about me!”
She wished for him to leave this place, and for him to not think of herself much.
At the very least, right now at the present instant, should she begin considering things aside from fighting, she would certainly burst into tears and cry.
She did not wish to show her weak side like this and trouble everyone.
And yetーー,

???: “ーーIts alright, Emilia-tan.”

The youth who had rushed in called her name.
Emotions she could not concern herself with, like anxiety, like sorrow, strummed and sprang within her chest due to simply that, for which she tried her best to make sure they did flow out.
After allーー,

Subaru: “ーーMy name is Natsuki Subaru. Emilia-tan’s one and only knight!”

Right now,『Emilia’s』heart was beating with such warmth, such warmth.








"
Chapter 77,“The Beacon of Counterattack”,"
Abiding by his warm emotions, dashing with the entirety of his might, he stepped foot into that place.
Opposite to his heart sending out hot-blooded pulses within the depths of his chest, the outside air had become chilly enough to whiten his exhales, and within this glaciated world, he discovered the back he was looking for.
“ーーーー”
His gaze plunged towards the slim, supple back, and his heart voluntarily came on the verge of bursting.
Though affection lighted his chest, he narrowly managed to suppress his impulse. This was no time for him to let his heart explode and die.
Powerfully gnashing his molars, he looked at the face of the enemy opposing on the other side of the struggling back.
Long hair of a dark brown hue, and a crude outfit as though being wreathed in rags. What was the most impressive, outstanding of all, was the revolting glint in eyes that trampled upon the lives of others, and had turned them into literal food articlesーー,
Subaru: “ーーLey Batenkaitos!!”
Roaring at the absolute top of his voice, he asserted his existence, and attracted the attention of the opponent.
Even gaining his attention for this singular moment alone, was beneficial. Of course, there lay the possibility of his side sustaining equal blows, but it was nothing if it meant reducing the damage being inflicted upon her.
With affection filling his heart as fuel, he could even fly in the sky right now.
???: “If that could increase our chances of winning, even slightly.”
Halting his feet before the frozen floor, he poured strength into his abdomen and glared at Ley. He maintained a watch at his movements with all of strength, and no matter what move should he makeーー,
???: “Ah……”
Such preparedness of Subaru’s was robbed and shattered by the amethyst eyes that suddenly turned backwards.
“ーーーー”
His black eyes and her amethyst eyes intermingled with each other.
The wave of emotions that appeared in her eyes at that instant was enormous, almost washing him away. Her eyes had always, always, gripped his heart and sought to drown it within themselves.
Because he wished to somehow save the entirety of the multiple emotions levitating in her eyes.
Thusーー,
???: “It’s dangerous so wait! Um, you may not, know about me, but he is the enemy! Leave this place to me! Even though you may not, know about me!”
His eyes twinkled upon seeing her call for vigilance whilst swaying her hands in panic.
Delayed by a beat, he gulped down the meaning behind her words. ーーThe『Memories』of being told this very same thing were certainly present within him. At the same time, he comprehended the turn of events.
And, he truly thought. ーーThat he was glad to have been the first one to reach this place.
He knew what he ought to say, how he ought to call out to her.
Furthermore, the thought of how he wanted to call out to her arose.
Subaru: “ーーIt’s alright, Emilia-tan.”
Sorry for causing problems for you, for making you worry, for making you wait.
Wielding those sentiments, though unbefitting for this place, he nodded whilst loosening his lips. And whilst looking at the young girl, whose eyes grasped comprehension by the few words he had said, he resumed.
With a finger of his right hand pointing towards the heavens, he posed with one hand on his waist.
Though there was no need for him to be doing this, doing this enabled him to solidify his resolve. For that purposeーー,
Subaru: “ーーMy name is Natsuki Subaru. Emilia-tan’s one and only knight!”
Emilia: “Subaruーー ~hk!!”
Subaru: “Bah!?”
The instant he declared so with a determined, smiling expression, the silver haired young girlーー Emilia dashed towards Subaru with fearsome velocity.
Colliding, Subaru was thrown backwards but he somehow supported Emilia’s frame. No need for concern, she was light as an angel’s feather. No problem at all.
But if there were to be something labelled a problemーー,
Subaru: “E-Emilia-tan!? This is so sudden I’m freaking surprised, and you’re also super light and smell so nice! Did you change your shampoo!?”
Emilia: “Stupid Subaru! Geez, you’re rea~lly so stupid! I was so, so worried! Yet just like that…… stupid! Stupid stupid!”
Subaru: “Wow you’re really calling me stupid an astounding number of times! Well, I can’t make any excuses……”
Subaru was overwhelmed as Emilia pressed him with widened eyes within his arms. Since he was meanwhile also glued together with Emilia, Subaru’s heart was a total mess and even his vocabulary crumbled.
Putting all this aside, Subaru reluctantly parted, grasped Emilia’s slender shoulders and distanced her body.
Subaru: “I’m sorry for making you worry. But, I’ve returned……. I’ve been revived? Restored? Or should I say, I’ve become the complete Natsuki Subaru, either way, it’s alright, so.”
Emilia: “Ah……”
Subaru: “I’ll leave all of Natsuki Subaru in the past. ーーThis is Natsuki Subaru’s explosive birth.” [1]
Energetically talking on and on, he forcefully attempted to exert Emilia’s relief. However, in the midst of this plan of Subaru’s, Emilia blinked and lay a single finger on his chest.
A ticklish, gentle sensation. Subaru involuntarily shivered.
Emilia: “Did you, properly become one?”
“ーーーー”
Emilia: “Because, even the Subaru who didn’t have memories, was Subaru. So, even if Subaru remembers everything now, that Subaru, who worked his hardest and put his life on the line even for the short while he was here for, was……”
Subaru: “ーーYeah, hm. It’s alright.”
Whilst touching his chest, Emilia affirmed Subaru’s footsteps with faltering words.
There existed a Natsuki Subaru who, due to the unification of『Memories』, could be interpreted as having become one or even having disappeared, and a time wherein their hearts were touched by him also existed within them.
‘ーーYeah, thus, it was simple.’
Subaru: “The fact that『I』was within myself, and within Emilia-tan, certainly remains even now. So, it really is alright, Emilia-tan.”
Emilia: “……Hm.”
Subaru: “So please expect great things here onward from Perfect Natsuki Subaru. With all the frustration piled up in this time of turmoil as the trigger, let’s & go towards a bright future!”
Emilia: “Sorry, I have no clue what you’re saying.”
Emilia shook her head and responded, as Subaru smiled with a single finger upraised.
This unkind attitude of her’s was also so lovable and something he eagerly looked forward to, Subaru would prefer to spend countless minutes, countless hours, countless days just messing around with Emilia like this, butーー,
???: “ーーAbout time you kno~w, had enough of your moving conversation?”
Saying so, raising his voice and calling out to the timidly touching Subaru and Emilia, was the Sin Archbishop of『Gluttony』with a devious, malicious, vicious smile.
But Subaru raised his eyebrows, in response to the fact that he did not launch an attack in this interval.
Subaru: “Yeah. I didn’t think you’d wait so conscientiously. Did you become contrite?”
Ley: “Become contr”eat” you say, that would be outrageous ~tsu! It’s just that, you know, we are『Gourmet』you see~. From onii-san’s perspective that’d be what you call gourmet? A~s one who knows the delight of meals, wanting to be pro~perly attentive to the setting of the table is what it’s about. If the table is untidy then it’s a kill-joy. Isn’t that right?”
Speaking of table manners difficult to apply practically, Ley laughed with a shrill voice in a strange and frivolous manner. Whilst listening to the ear-hurting voice of his laughter, Subaru gave a deep nod.
And,
Subaru: “I see, makes sense. I completely thought……”
Ley: “Completely thought?”
Subaru: “That you got all afraid, considering how ugly of a shape your little sister was left in.”
Ley: “ーー~tsu.”
The next instant, Ley’s expression completely changed from that of having a smile of leisure.
His smile disappeared in an instant, what appeared instead was scorching rage. Abiding by that intense fury, Ley’s body kicked the frozen aisle and plunged ahead in the blink of an eye.
Ley: “What would ‘you’, know about our Louisーー ~tsu!!”
Subaru: “I know nothing. I just arbitrarily had my body be entered by her. I have no idea what she was thinking, nor do I want to know.”
Seemingly truly possessing sentiments and love for his younger sister, enraged Ley’s dagger inched closer towards Subaru. However, Subaru did not fear the approaching footsteps of『Death』.
Controlled by violent emotion, if Ley was not viewing anything but Subaru then that was precisely what he was aiming forーー,
Emilia: “ーーI’m also here, don’t, forget!”
Ley: “Gah, bgh ~tsu.”
Accompanied by a brave voice, Emilia’s beautiful, long legs drew an arc. Energetically rotating it to a large degree, she intercepted Ley’s face as he plunged straight ahead.
The instant of the direct hit, Emilia’s ice battle technique『Ice Brand Arts』activated and reinforced her toes, which were striking the enemy, with boots of ice as bonus.
Emilia: “U, riya~a~a~a~!”
Pouring strength into her fair leg, Emilia completely swung the leg which had struck the enemy’s frontal teeth. Despite somehow defending against direct damage, Ley’s petite stature was unable to withstand that force and was pushed away, as he slid on the frozen floor and landed towards the interior of the aisle.
Emilia subsequently pointed her palm towards that direction, and the generated stumps of ice mercilessly pursued Louis’ elder brother, having collapsed, icicle dust then engulfed the aisle, seemingly succeeding in inflicting enormous damage onto『Gluttony』.
Subaru: “That did it! This was a mixed attack of my instigation and Emilia-tan’s adorable intent to kill!”
Emilia: “Is that supposed to be a compliment?”
Subaru: “It is a compliment indeed! The best! So cute! I wanna marry you!”
Emilia: “Marr…… geez, no messing around.”
With her cheeks slightly red, Emilia’s reaction as she fixedly looked towards him was unexpected. He thought her refute would be more powerful, so the embarrassment rebounded onto Subaru as well.
Subaru: “No no, I’m acting way too merry since having met with Emilia-tan. All messing about comes after the problems have been solved.”
Emilia: “Subaru! I don’t know when another attack will come! So don’t let your guard down!”
Subaru: “I know! Though I’d openly welcome it if this makes for his defeat……”
Straightening out their minds at once, Subaru and Emilia turned towards breaking the deadlock of the situationーー Emilia concentrated on Ley Batenkaitos before her eyes, whilst Subaru concentrated on the problems encircling the Pleiades Watchtower.
The five obstaclesーー even after Natsuki Subaru’s identity problem had been solved, they still remained and exposed this watchtower and all of Subaru’s comrades within it to hazard.
But some conditions had changed. For example, the menace of the shadow that descended as though symbolising a time limit, swallowing the entire tower and bringing ruin to everything.
If that wasーー,
Subaru: “If that is, the penalty as the way I’ve imagined it till now……”
The event of the shadow swallowing everything, was the reappearance of the catastrophe he had formerly encountered in the『Sanctuary』as well.
The story behind why that happened was because he had spoken to Echidna within the『Graveyard』and had unburdened himself by telling her everything about『Return by Death』. If the happenings occurring in this tower were also of the same kind, then that shadow resetted everything in cases when『Return by Death』had been largely leaked outside.
In other words, it was surely because Louis Arneb had been within Subaru.
Now that Louis Arneb had been eliminated, and her existence had disappeared from Subaru’s interior, there was around a 50% chance that shadow would swallow the Pleiades Watchtower.
Hence he did not possess the option to rely on that and let the circumstances proceed slowly.
Subaru: “Emilia-tan! I have a plan!”
Emilia: “ーー! Got it! Then, let’s follow it!”
Subaru: “I haven’t said anything yet though!?”
Subaru arranged the options in his mind and accordingly called out to her, and the next instant came Emilia’s ready consent flying towards him without him having said a single word of explanation.
Subaru was surprised, as Emilia said “It’s fine!” in response,
Emilia: “Subaru’s plan must be one he came up with after thinking with all his might! I can trust it far more than having to think about a lot of things and coming up with an answer here!”
Subaru: “ーーAh, damn it! Makes me so happy you’d say that!”
Scratching his head, Subaru powerfully stomped the floor as though in response to the faith that made him feel uneasy. Afterwards, Subaru pointed towards the interior of the aisle, the space filled with icicle dust,
Subaru: “For now, Emilia-tan, another shot at him!”
Emilia: “Aye!”
With an explosive, dynamic sound, Emilia dropped the floe of ice onto the interior of the aisle.
It would be great if this merciless strike made for the finishing blow for Ley, but that would be a dim prospect. In reality, Emilia spilled out a note saying “Ah!” as she widened her eyes upon the impact,
Emilia: “Subaru! The Sin Archbishop from earlier……”
Subaru: “Tch, he’s a tenacious bastard. But there should be no way he took absolutely no damage.”
When Emilia turned backward, Subaru understood from her expression that Ley had erased his form from the course of impact.
He had gotten fed up of that tenaciousness, on the same level as that of a cockroach, but his characteristic of judging the situation to be unfavorable and ejecting accordingly was different from Petelgeuse of aggravated diligence and tactless frankness, or Regulus who did not possess the word “Humility” in his dictionary. ーーAmongst the Sin Archbishops, Ley Batenkaitos had the greatest survival instinct.
However, it was inconceivable that he would withdraw from the tower.
Subaru: “Emilia-tan! For now, we meet up with everyone else! We need to re-allot the deployments of our personnel! Everyone needs to do their best or this situation won’t be broken through!”
Emilia: “Right! But, is it okay if we let him escape like that?”
Subaru: “I’ll be honest, I would’ve preferred if the one from earlier would’ve finished him off but……”
Having retreated once, Ley would surely make the best use of this time to catch up on his breath as well. In that case, it would be difficult to calculate the necessary time and certainty for striking Ley.
Then they might as well prioritise planned movement in this situation, and take custody of his life.
Subaru: “No need to worry, he won’t leave the tower or anything. As he’s stimulated a lot because of Louis…… because of his little sister. The misunderstanding siscon bastard won’t back down.”
Emilia: “Sisskon……?”
Subaru: “It means one who is affectionate to their younger sister. Though in their case, it’d be being affectionate to the little sister in a negative sense.”
At the very least, it did not seem as though Louis deeply loved Ley or Roy, her true elder brothers, very much on her end. To devote themselves for the sake of Louis without even knowing that, they were either pitiable victims or just role-playing maniacs intoxicated with that duty.
However, ironically, only the unbending distorted ways of the Sin Archbishops could be relied on.
Subaru: “Someone who can adapt to circumstances and flexibly change methods to deal with something, wouldn’t become something like a Sin Archbishop in the first place.”
That was Subaru’s Sin Archbishop evaluation, having unwillingly repeatedly come in contact with the Sin Archbishops.
Hence, it was not easy to track down the dirtily living Ley Batenkaitos. Meanwhile, situations Subaru could not interfere with continued to head towards ruin.
Before that happenedーー,
Subaru: “Emilia-tan! We go where everyone is!”
Emilia: “Mhm, got it! But, I don’t know where everyone is……”
Subaru: “ーーIt is my duty, to SubaNavi ’em.”
Natsuki Subaru Navigation System.
ーーSubaNavi for short, referring to『Cor Leonis』, he activated.
“ーーーー”
Queer, deep emotions came to his mind upon the activation of the Authority wherein coexisted familiar and unfamiliar sensations.
Concentrating the whereabouts of his beating heart, he magnified everything within the close range of his radar with his beating heart at the centre. That was close to sonar, which grasped the surroundings based on the reverberation of sounds.
But, what he could feel was his comrades’ warmth and fleeting lights, thus it was a restrictive sensation.
ーーHowever, that which specialised solely in feeling the existence of his comrades, rather than being an omnipotent might, was presently the Authority of the most worth for Subaru.
Figuring the location of those fleeting lights, Subaru lifted his face.
Just as he had first hurriedly met up with Emilia, next, they shall prioritise meeting up with the members she had earlier enabled to run away.
In other wordsーー,
Subaru: “ーーFirst, we retrieve my cute partner!”

△▼△▼△▼△

ーーThrough the sensations being conveyed from『Cor Leonis』, Subaru grasped large sections of the happenings occuring in Pleiades Watchtower.
What he understood through the effect of the Authority was, at maximum, the individual respective conditions of his comrades and a vague sense of distance with Subaru at the centre. His comrades’ fields of vision could be shared, but he could not grasp their state with clarity.
But still, should they sustain an injury he could substitute for the injury, and should they be burdened with recoil, he could take over the recoil. That was the effect of Subaru’s Authority of『Greed』, and various usages could be mused for it
Emilia: “Subaru, are you okay? You look pale……”
Subaru: “Mhm, yeah, I’m good I’m good. Well, I’m acting strong a bit, but I’m still alright. I can still work hard at this level.”
As they dashed through the aisle side by side, Emilia worried for Subaru whilst he let out a heavy sigh. Her voice, like a silver bell, and her amethyst eyes tickled his heart, and Subaru revealed his honest thoughts.
It was agonising. But he could still endure it. Those were his true thoughts.
“ーーーー”
As pointed out by Emilia, Subaru’s paleness was also of course due to the chaos that had unfolded with Louis in order to recover the『Memories』. Mental abrasion is quite difficult to heal, and it is not an easy task to make a worn down heart stand up again.
But, what was presently making Subaru suffer was a much more simple, clear cause. ーーRam’s inferior physical form, because he had been preliminarily taking up the anguish she had always been experiencing on a normal basis.
Subaru: “Taking up her wounds without permission, Ram is sure not going to be happy……”
It would never sit well with Ram, who actually possessed a strong sense of responsibility, to let others substitute for her own recoil. Should he propose to her saying “I want to shoulder your pain together with you” at her face, she would simply laugh it off with a snort, and in the end stuff steamed potatoes in his nose.
So, he shall arbitrarily shoulder Ram’s inferior physical form. He shan’t let her refuse.
That is whyーー,
Emilia: “Subaru!”
By the shattered angle of the aisle, as she saw clearly ahead Emilia called Subaru. The meaning behind her call was known by Subaru, whose『Lion’s Heart』was beating.
The comrades that had escaped from the battlefield and taken distance, whilst Emilia preoccupied Ley.
The jet black Ground Dragon, and the blue-haired young girl on its back. Holding its reins was her elder sister possessing an identical face like two peas in a pod, and standing beside her was a little girl in a dressーー,
Subaru: “Beako!!”
Emilia: “Beatrice!”
Beatrice: “ーー~hk, S-Subaru and a god-knows-who girl are here, in fact!?”
Beatrice turned behind to look at Subaru and Emilia, who were energetically dashing towards them.
Paying no heed to her astonishment, Subaru and Emilia reached her at almost the same time.
At the same pace, he hugged and picked up the young girl as she shouted “Wakya~”,
Subaru: “Oh, Beako! Beako, you’re so light! You’re so cute! You’ve got such an intelligent look!”
Beatrice: “Wa, wa, wa, wa……”
Emilia: “Look, Beatrice! Subaru remembered everything! Ah, wait, you still don’t know who I am, isn’t that right…… but, Subaru remembered! That rea~lly made me so happy……”
Beatrice: “W-Wait, I suppose! Wait, in fact! It’s like both a known occasion and an unknown occasion have arrived, so Betty’s mind is all topsy-turvy, I suppose!”
Whilst being swung around, Beatrice was mutually knocked down by Subaru and Emilia’s words, as she darted her eyes about in confusion. However, she immediately pointed her palm forward, making Emilia shut up, and,
Beatrice: “……Subaru.”
Subaru: “Yeah.”
Beatrice: “Do you, truly, remember everything, in fact? About Betty, about the time you’ve spent with Betty as well, everything?”
Subaru: “Yeah, that’s right. Don’t make such an anxious expression. I remember everything, and if anything can just make up a lot of the stuff too. The historia of everything that happened and didn’t happen between you and me.”
Beatrice: “No need to make up what didn’t happen, I suppose! Agh geez!”
Raised up in his arms, Beatrice sandwiched Subaru’s face between her hands. Looking at the silent Subaru from an inch’s worth of distance, Beatrice let out a deep sigh.
Her eyes, with a peculiar pattern on them, subsequently quivered,
Beatrice: “Truly, all Subaru does is swing Betty around, in fact.”
Subaru: “The contract’s condition was that I’d be a contractor who’d never let you get bored, after all. And, you said that I’m no superman……”
Beatrice: “ーー?”
Subaru: “Looking at it objectively, I’m pretty superman-ly, am I not?”
Closing an eye, Subaru winked and smiled at Beatrice. For an instant Beatrice widened her eyes at his response, but then immediately pouted.
Beatrice: “Don’t get carried away, I suppose!”
Subaru: “Let me get carried away. I’m the type who gets things done when I get carried away. Along with that……”
“ーーーー”
Glancing sideways, he noticed Ram standing there with a dazed expression. She narrowed her light crimson eyes and looked at Subaru with a piercingーー no, stabbing gaze.
Subaru: “Ah, nee-sama?”
Ram: “That was quite the fast snowmelt, isn’t it. Ultimately, a pointless fuss befitting of Barusu.”
Subaru: “……Well, in essence, I guess it did last only for a day.”
Subaru couldn’t do anything but smile wryly, upon it all being labelled as a pointless fuss.
In reality, close to twenty deaths that Subaru had experienced, upon thinking of the mental recoil he had undertaken for the purpose of accepting them all as his own, it would be impossible to think that all of the happenings had been a matter of a single day.
From Subaru’s perspective, it felt as if the amnesia had lasted for several years.
Subaru: “But, I’ve come to terms with everything and made it back. The man who gives 150% of his strength for everyone, Natsuki Subaru, pleased to be in your company.”
Ram: “Hah! How nice. Kindly say whatever you would like. However, Ram’s exceedingly benevolent self shall overlook it……”
Subaru: “Overlook it? ……Bangladesh!?”
Beatrice: “Kya~, in fact!”?
Ram spoke deeply meaningful words and subsequently paused, and just as he tilted his head upon her words he was blown away by a tail whip that targeted his blind spot coming from the Ground Dragon, together with Beatrice.
As Subaru and Beatrice twirled around, they were caught by a soft sensation. Upon looking, it had been Emilia who halted their spinning. She softly supported Subaru’s body from his back’s side and smiled,
Emilia: “It looks like Patrasche-chan is also rea~lly happy that Subaru came back.”
“ーーーー”
Ahead of Emilia’s line of sight stood a jet black majestic figure, exhaling from its nose.
Having gotten a taste of one of its powerful tail strikes, Subaru readjusted Beatrice, whom he was carrying in his arms and,
Subaru: “You’ve always been such a tsundere…… no, my bad. I made you worry a lot too. In the first place……”
“ーーーー”
Receiving Emilia’s support, Subaru fixed his stance and faced Patrasche, who was looking at him with a sharp glint in its eyes. And, thinking back to the unchanging devotion of the affectionate dragon during the time he was devoid of『Memories』,
Subaru: “Really, you save me so many times. I love you.”
“ーーーー”
Subaru: “……So you’re not going to slap me away like usual, right?”
Every time he made a flimsy confession of love to her, it was standard that Patrasche’s lady-like self would discipline him, but that wasn’t the case with this time’s confession of his. Otherwise,
Beatrice: “Even this Ground Dragon can tell when you’re joking and when you’re being serious, is what it means, I suppose.”
Subaru: “……Yeah.”
Nobody knew when she had gotten so close to it, but Beatrice spoke for Patrasche’s true heart. The fact that she didn’t get struck by another tail whip meant that her interpretation was correct.
Now if Beatrice were to also learn the ability of deciphering and translating, then Otto could finally be dismissed of his duty.
Subaru: “ーーRem.”
On Patrasche’s back was Rem, her body leaning on the saddle.
Of course, it shan’t be possible to hear her eternally asleep self’s voice of delight upon the return of Subaru’s『Memories』. However, the emotion that arose within Subaru’s heart upon looking at Rem’s side profile was different.
“ーーーー”
What if, in that white world, persuaded by Louis Arneb’s cajolery, the instant he was truly going to fall into『Gluttony’s』poison fangs, had there not been the voice which kicked the hopeless weakling up.
The existence known as her, truly, shan’t let Natsuki Subaru loose, even should he forget himself.
That is why, once again, after overcoming a totality of 40『Deaths』, he ended up coming back.
Subaru: “I’ll save getting lost in thoughts for later. Anyway, my memories are back. I appreciate all of you wanting to celebrate it, but let’s clean up the situation at once.”
Ram: “Celebrate you say, truly, what an overestimation of oneself. Wonder what happened in this short duration…… besides.”
Emilia: “ーー. Ah, me?”
Snorting her nose upon Subaru’s lowered tone, Ram then turned her gaze towards Emilia. Levitating in her eyes was usual arrogance, and an equal sense of unease.
It was clear from Beatrice’s reaction, but indeedーー,
Emilia: “I’m Emilia. You don’t remember, I guess, yeah……”
Ram: “……The person who let Ram and others escape earlier, that is known. But, that is all, nothing further can be remembered. How do things stand for you, Beatrice-sama……”
Beatrice: “Same for, Betty, in fact…… the effect of the Authority of『Gluttony』, is what it is, I suppose.”
At Ram’s assent, Beatrice identically lowered her face.
What had occurred to Julius’s person in Priestella, had descended onto Emilia’s person within this tower as well. With this forming an omnipresent excruciating woundーー,
Emilia: “Right! I am Emilia, just Emilia. There’s lots of stuff I want to say, but I am family who is looking in the same direction as both Beatrice and Ram!”
“ーーーー”
Emilia: “If you can just understand that much, then for now, I will be fine. Ever since I got to know that Subaru remembered, I’m feeling rea~lly good.”
Emilia flexed the biceps of her fair arms, and stout-heartedlyーー no, she was not merely acting strong, but truly seeming to fear nothing, smiled. Not only Subaru but Beatrice also came at a loss for words upon her exceedingly confident conduct. Unusually enough, even Ram widened her eyes, unable to suppress her astonishment.
Emilia: “Huh? Did I say something weird?”
Subaru: “……Well, rather than weird, it was super-duper cool.”
Scratching his cheeks, Subaru answered upon Emilia’s slightly flustered reaction. Subsequent to Subaru’s response, Ram said “Indeed” and took a deep inhale.
She steadily affirmed Emilia’s conduct and,
Ram: “Emilia, was it. Enigmatically enough, upon looking at you Ram feels the nooks of her mind be awfully uneasy…… The same happened, on Rem’s instance.”
Emilia: “That’s……”
Ram: “Everything about you disappearing from the mind and being replaced by a void is difficult, is what it surely means. Though it is difficult to consider that Ram had someone like that other than Rem.”
Narrowing her eyes, Ram touched her head with a finger as though tracing Emilia’s disappeared existence within herself. Her words made Subaru remember something out-of-place.
Though Ram may say so, it was unmistakable for Subaru, who had been witness to the two’s relationship from the sidelines, that she cherished Emilia. Although with the vanishing of those spans of time, it was only natural that it would not come to Ram’s mind.
Howeverーー,
Ram: “The throbbing and aching of the mind Ram feels upon looking at you, is the answer for the relationship between you and Ram. So, rest assured. ーーRam, dislikes remaining defeated.”
Emilia: “ーー. The same, goes for me. We’re going to strike back, absolutely, no matter what.”
Ram: “Indeed, let the payback be a hundred million times greater.”
Emilia: “That many times!?”
Subaru felt Emilia and Ram to be reliable, as the two exchanged fearless smiles.
After all, originally, once the『Name』was plundered, the victim drowned in isolation as all relationships around them collapsed. However, Emilia did not give in against isolation and managed to retain the core of her heart. Thanks to that, the collapse supposed to commence from her, could not destroy the foundation of Subaru as well as that of Ram and the others.
On top of thatーー,
Ram: “Barusu, kindly give suggestions. However, do not think that just because your forgetful self managed to remember again, all of the missteps so far can be salvaged.”
Subaru: “I know without you having to point it out, but how many things do you plan to point out!”
But, he was grateful that they were willing to be cooperative without having to be convinced.
Anyhow, the dilemmas laid within this tower of the sand sea were far too impending for accumulating trust, explaining the situation, and confronting each one of the problems whilst tying bonds.
Henceーー,
Subaru: “Let’s obliterate this overeating festival those utmost worst three siblings started with the power of our bonds.”
Emilia: “Yes!”
Beatrice: “Naturally, in fact.”
Ram: “Hah!”
The three parties gave their three respective answers directed towards three of Subaru’s greatest enemies, as he gave a deep nod to all of their words.
And,

Subaru: “ーーIt’s still all over the place, but it feels like I’ve come back home!”
Saying so, he vocalised first and foremost a quiet, yet a valuable and definite deep emotion.

"
Chapter 78,“The Four Corners”,"Subaru: […Are you ready? The tower’s in pretty bad shape right now. If I were to go out and say how bad it is, it’s nearly as bad as playing Othello with all four of its corners taken away from you.]
Ram: [That… must be pretty bad.]
Ram’s expression clouded over as Subaru launched into his explanation, holding one of his fingers up in the air. Quite the solemn look had appeared on the latter’s face. Albeit, Ram wasn’t the only one who was taking this seriously. Emilia and Beatrice, who were listening in as well, were like that too.
Othello ― more commonly referred to by the name Reversi ― was a board game in which two players competed on an 8×8 = 64 board using black and white pieces.
Naturally this was knowledge Subaru had brought with him from his original world. But since it had been relatively easy to recreate the game here, he’d introduced it to the Roswaal mansion fairly early on. It brought a huge stir, with it being extremely well received, especially from Emilia.
That’s why he was able to properly convey the gravity of the current situation to them. Having all four of your corners taken away from you in Othello meant that you were already completely lost.
Furthermore, though she hadn’t partaken in it much, Ram had literally been as strong as an Oni in the few occasions she’d played, as one would expect from her.
In any case…
Beatrice: [Losing all four corners, an utterly outrageous situation, I suppose… That’s going too far, even as a handicap, in fact.]
Emilia: [I guess even I’d end up becoming as busy as a bee and winning if I got ahold of so many of them…]
Subaru: [Who even says “busy as a bee” these days…]
Emilia: […! Subaru, can you say that again?]
Subaru: [I will, but later. Later.]
Emilia snapped onto Subaru’s traditional retort, looking somewhat dejected at having her request denied. Although he felt a bit guilty seeing her like that, the flirting would have to wait until later, just like he’d said many times.
Their first priority was to find a way out of the situation they were in. And for that…
Subaru: [The four corners… They’re the two “Gluttonies” inside the tower, as well as the swarm of Witchbeasts they’ve called with them. Also, it pains me to say this, but our companion… Oh yeah, I guess it’s sorta debatable if I can call them that…]
Everyone: […?]
Subaru had been about to mention the fourth corner, but for a split second he’d faltered on what to say next.
Namely because not even he had come up with an answer that would both be simple to understand and properly describe the woman who unintentionally stood in their way as the fourth corner.
He wasn’t so distant with her to call her an acquaintance. That, and their connection wasn’t weak enough to be called bitter enemies either. But, did they share enough of a destiny such that he could call her a companion? At the very least, he could perhaps leave it at them having sort of like a clueless, but very much unsanctioned teacher and student relationship.
Still, how did Emilia and the rest of them view her?
But, as Subaru fell prey to his hesitation…
Emilia: [You said companion right? What’s happened to Shaula?]
Subaru: […]
Emilia: […? Subaru?]
Subaru: [No, it’s nothing. That’s right, I do mean Shaula.]
Subaru immediately acted like nothing was up and nodded back at Emilia. It hadn’t been just her; Beatrice and Ram also hadn’t seen anything wrong with how Emilia had recognised her.
The way they’d perceived her had been the same as Emilia, regardless of whether they had memories of the latter or not. In other words, it served as proof that they viewed Shaula as someone friendly to them.
Subaru: [Was I being an idiot…? Yeah, of course I was.]
Stumbling over the obvious was a bad habit of Natsuki Subaru. Yet, he would reflect hard on things, leveraging them so that he could give it his all; and this, was one of his strengths.
A compliment, for each time he put himself down. Ideally he would give himself a hundred for each time he did.
That much would do. Though the true ideal would be giving himself ten thousand compliments without putting himself down even once.
Subaru: [Anyways, about Shaula… Well before that, do you remember the tower rules? The ones that mustn’t be broken. They were explained before, right?]
Ram: [Yes, they were. We can’t leave without completing the Trials, we can’t break the rules of the Trials, we can’t disrespect the libraries, we can’t damage the tower… I think those were all the violations.]
Subaru: [Yeah, precisely.]
Subaru snapped his fingers at Ram after she’d readily laid them out. Then he pointed down at his feet and swung his arm around, indicating the entire tower.
Subaru: [So, with those rules… The fourth corner shows up when one of them is broken. I don’t know which one specifically, but one of them will. Then, after that…]
Ram: [She’ll bare her fangs at us, just like she said. ――How annoying.]
Ram, assuming her typical pose with her arms crossed together, batted one of her eyes shut as she imagined the worst.
Shaula’s insane combat prowess was well known to Subaru of course, considering he’d gone through many loops where she’d killed him. But other than him, the rest of them were also well aware of it after they’d been showered by sniper-fire from afar, back in the sand sea.
Beatrice: [That vapid girl is quite strong when she uses those things of hers, I suppose. Even if we’re better off than before, where we couldn’t do a thing due to being attacked from afar, it’s not going to change the fact that things are going to get grim if she turns into our enemy, in fact.]
With their arms folded, both Beatrice and Ram frowned, their brows wrinkling up.
The fact that they were so quick on the uptake was a huge help, since he could cut down the time he spent explaining. From all those sullen faces, it was only Emilia that raised her hand. Her face, which was the cutest in the whole-wide world, was still free of wrinkles,
Emilia: [But we’d be going up against Shaula, no? Can’t we somehow persuade her by talking to her? Shaula’s suuuuper attached to Subaru, so if he tried his hardest, maybe…]
Subaru: [I’d love a peaceful resolution to this, but getting Shaula to the negotiating table seems like a tall order. In regards to her being attached to me…, I guess nothing about that’s changed, in a broad sense.]
Ram: [Meaning she’s going to be primarily targeting you, Barusu. The fact that she’s got her targets narrowed down is going to be extremely useful.]
It could be perceived as her targeting the weaker members in their camp, but regardless, Subaru agreed with Ram’s thoughts.
Rather than facing a situation where they wouldn’t know who’d be targeted by the enemies indiscriminately lurking in the tower, it would be easier to come up with a plan of counterattack that involved having Subaru recklessly targeted.
So, putting the issues they were facing in a nutshell…
Beatrice: […The four corners are: the two Gluttonies, their swarm of Witchbeasts, as well as Shaula, who’ll come to attack us, I suppose.]
Subaru: [Though two of these corners are already being dealt with. All thanks to Beako taking command.]
During the time Subaru had spent cowering in the “Taygeta” Library, the smart and adorable Beatrice had taken everyone with her in turn, and got them busy dealing with the damage that had struck the tower.
She’d sent Meili to the balcony, where she could overlook the swarm of Witchbeasts. Then, as part of that, she’d also joined up with Ram and Emilia after they’d taken Rem out of the Green Room―― Unfortunately though, they’d encountered Ley en-route, which had led to them falling into this situation where Emilia’s name had been taken away from her.
Emilia: [Mhmnh, it’s okay. Subaru still remembers me, so I’m completely fine with it. Even though he often ends up forgetting about our promises, it still makes me reaaaaally happy that he remembers me properly.]
Subaru: [Nnh, what’s with stabbing me in the back all of a sudden?]
Beatrice: [It looks to me like it’s just her usual, in fact. That girl seems to know you well too, I suppose. Though not as well as I do.]
Subaru: [No need to fight over me my sweethearts.]
Subaru gave a few nods as he stroked Beatrice’s head, basking in their affection for him. Then, while still steeped in emotion, Ram called out to him with a “Barusu”,
Ram: [You said that two of the corners are being dealt with, right? I know that one of them is Meili holding back the swarm of Witchbeasts, but what about the other one?]
Subaru: […Julius.]
Subaru grabbed his chest in reply to Ram and turned his attention to the beating of his heart.
His “Cor Leonis” power was still going strong. He was naturally taking Ram’s burdens from her. Also, the whereabouts of his companions were being broadcasted to him in real-time.
From those, there was a light that definitely seemed to correspond to Julius. And the place he was at was…
Subaru: […He’s on the second floor, locked in battle with the enemy.]
Emilia: [The second floor… you can’t mean that…]
Subaru: [Yeah, I do.]
He nodded back at Emilia as she quickly turned pale, before sneaking a furtive glance up above.
He couldn’t see it firsthand, since the ceiling was in the way, but he could most definitely feel the signs of the furious fight that was taking place beyond his gaze.
――Julius Euculius and Reid Astrea’s rematch had begun.
Subaru: […]
In the end, it looked like he hadn’t been able to avoid a conclusion to it.
After Subaru had fallen to his knees earlier, unable to pick himself back up, Beatrice had taken charge of their companions. The opponent Julius had ended up waging battle with had been Reid Astrea, even under Beatrice’s command.
That naturally had been influenced by the fact Roy Alphard ― Or rather, Reid, who’d taken over the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony’s body and gained his freedom, actively sought its conclusion.
Nevertheless, Subaru had gone through many “deaths” and crossed through many possibilities whether he’d wanted to or not. And that had made him understand something.
――As annoying as it was, fate existed.
No matter what road you followed, the firm, unchangeable reality that lay there was called fate.
The fluctuations of history were so unyielding, to the point it really made you believe things were predetermined. It was almost like the results had already been determined by fate, with all the branches converging there.
That had been the outcome of all of their wills coming together to try and achieve their respective goals. However, precisely because of that, they’d become so closely entwined with each other, that they’d never come apart.
Yet, couldn’t it also be said that meant there was no hope ahead?
Considering that the conclusion between Julius Euculius and Reid Astrea was inevitable, it could only mean that…
Subaru: [Reid should have assimilated with one of the Gluttonies, his take-over should be almost done. Though we’ll let Julius settle things with Reid. We’re going to deal with the remaining three.]
Ram: [Is that really going to be okay, Barusu?]
Subaru: […? What do you mean?]
Subaru cocked his head earnestly in response to Ram’s question. But on seeing him react like that she just muttered out a brief: “Nevermind,”
Ram: [I already know how Barusu goes about things. Looks like I’m losing my edge as well. I suppose we have no choice but to rely on Barusu’s proposal.]
Subaru: [I don’t really fully get what you mean, but you do know I can tell you’re making fun of me?]
Emilia: [Huh? No, no, she’s just complimenting you. Ram’s saying that she relies on you a loooot, Subaru. Hehe, now I’m gonna need to work hard.]
Ram: […I will be having a word with you later, Emilia.]
Emilia replied back to the mortified Ram with a “Yessir”, a slightly happy trill in her voice.
Despite the situation they were in, Emilia was most likely glad, and found it refreshing that Ram wasn’t using honorifics to address her. Now that their master-servant connection was gone, the attitude she was showing Emilia was one of perhaps friends, or maybe a little sister that was always quite a handful.
Ram didn’t have the opportunity anymore to play the part of the capable big sister now that her actual little sister didn’t require much to handle. Nevertheless, she seemed that way now thanks to the bizarrely happy-go-lucky Emilia.
Subaru: [Anyways, that’s it for what’s going on in the tower. What we need to do next is sort out the best people for each place. This sorting business is where Natsuki Subaru really shines!]
Ram: [You sure are really humble…]
Subaru: [Humble or not, it’s still important work! This is what they mean when they talk about unsung heroes! This is something only I… That’s right, this is something only I can do! This is my battle… Owowowow!!]
Ram: [Just hurry up and start sorting.]
Ram slapped his face for spending too long on the preambles. Feeling the pain of the damage he’d received, Subaru looked around at all three of their faces―― as well as the earth dragon’s, and said: “Are you all ready?”
From here on out, it would be all out war, in its truest sense. It barely made any difference whether you were a human or earth dragon; and in the first place, Patrasche was typically far more useful than Subaru himself.
But if you added Super-Subaru into the mix, their possibilities would explode ten-fold, and then double.
(TL Note: The bit above seems to be a reference to the Japanese Quiz Show: Quiz Derby.)
Subaru: [One for all, all for one. All for one, one for all. We can’t win without having everyone on board. We can’t have even one of us missing. We will start winning if we’ve got everyone, because we…]
(TL Note: Subaru says the first sentence which I italicised in Engrish before repeating the Japanese equivalent.)
Emilia: […Because we came to this tower to get back what was taken from us, we won’t allow ourselves to lose them.]
Subaru: [Exactly.]
Subaru gave Emilia a nod with a snap of his fingers before regaining his composure.
Subaru: [So, first things first, Ley Batenkaitos’ opponent shall be…]
△▼△▼△▼△
???: […Barusu.]
Subaru: [Huh?]
They began to head to their posts after they’d finished their discussion. However, someone grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and forced him to a halt before he could. Though, there hadn’t been enough force in it to throttle him.
There’d probably been a reason why they’d shown such consideration.
Subaru: [It’s really not like you to care enough to not hurt me, nee-sama.]
Ram: [It’s not like I would bother using too much of my strength when looking at a fly trapped in the palm of my hand. This is the same as that… Though, it’s not like I would purposely put one there. That’d be disgusting.]
Subaru: [Don’t just say it and then deny it!]
Subaru shrugged his shoulders at Ram’s Ram-like phrasing. Standing in front of him, Ram softly clenched and unclenched the palm of her hand, checking its feel a few times.
Her gestures carried faint traces of bewilderment in them. This was quite the rare sight for Subaru, so used was he in seeing Ram always acting aloof.
It was quite a perk to witness her acting so perplexed and unsure of herself. It was only thanks to this that he could put up with the levels of exhaustion that were threatening to crush his entire body.
Subaru: […]
Ram’s body was constantly tormented by the burden of being “Hornless”. Subaru took over this burden when he used his Cor Leonis, which in turn gave her the extra strength that let her operate to her fullest. Cor Leonis was one of their most essential tricks for beating this tower.
Subaru had already given Ram a brief summary of what was happening to her, albeit setting aside the fine details.
Simply put, Ram’s burdens were flowing into him, making Ram’s body a lot lighter in those respects. However, since it strained him terribly, he desired a speedy settlement to the situation they were in. That was it, more or less.
Ram: [Now that I think about it, since it’s just going to be you who’s suffering Barusu, I don’t really care how long it’ll last.]
Subaru: [But this is a joint effort between you and me, nee-sama. You must want to get this over as soon as possible when you think about it like that, right?]
Ram: [Yeah. You repulse me.]
Subaru: [Don’t you think using repulse is going a little too far…]
Though, well, throwing abuse at me is so typical of her.
Subaru accepted that, all the while suppressing the urge to vomit. Ram stared at him, assuming her familiar pose with her arms folded in front of him.
Ram: […Barusu. I won’t be taking it easy.]
Subaru: […]
Naturally, the more Ram moved using the full capabilities of her body, the greater the burden he would need to take, acting as its counterbalance. Even so, if he wanted to keep Ram in this state, he’d need to be prepared to take on all of that extra burden.
Just her standing there breathing was already plenty to make him groan. And that was just the pain she experienced in her typical daily life.
Subaru: [Nee-sama is too kind, huh.]
That was how the still sleeping Rem would frequently assess her. He hadn’t really gotten it back then, but now he finally understood what she’d meant.
If he were to let himself preface it in typical Ram fashion, it’d be something like: “That’s how Ram goes about things”.
Ram: [Barusu?]
Subaru: [It’s nothing. ――Definitely don’t take it easy of course. I can tell whether you’re in serious-mode or not by how much pain I’m in. What torture it is.]
Ram: [So, you’re saying your plan is the kind where the better I feel, the more you’ll suffer?]
Subaru: [I feel like I’ve just handed the switch to the nukes to the one person I shouldn’t have.]
Then again, if Subaru was going to hand over the switch to the nukes to one of his compatriots, Ram was the only one he’d consider for it.
Subaru: [Otto would be a good bet as well, if not for the fact I’d worry he’d probably slip and accidentally push it… You’re the most reliable in the sense of who’d use it properly nee-sama.]
Ram: [Hah! Flattery will get you nowhere… Listen, take good care of Emilia and Beatrice-sama. I don’t care what happens to you Barusu, since I know you’re always a mess whatever the case.]
Subaru: [Yeah Yeah, I know. And about Rem…]
Ram: [――The one who cares the most about Rem in this world, is me.]
Ram declared that as if she were stating a matter of course. Her crimson eyes narrowed as Subaru’s breath was taken away by the sheer intensity of her words.
Ram: [Let’s just say that it’s enough that you, in your own Barusu-like way, are the person who cares about her the second-most in the world. Leaving it at that shouldn’t unsettle even a single hair on Rem’s head.]
Subaru: […Yeah, or it’d make me want to die.]
Ram turned her back on Subaru after they’d exchanged their feelings.
There were probably so many things that she wanted to say, words that she wanted to leave him, but she’d quickly changed her attitude, putting an end to them there.
That was truly how Ram went about things.
Ram: [Kindly take care of yourself as much as possible, Barusu. Otherwise, if you die, you won’t be able to see Rem again.]
Subaru: [Yeah, love you too.]
Subaru likewise replied jokingly to Ram’s facetious concerns.
And so, Subaru watched her run off into the distance saying nary a word, before then planting his feet firmly down onto the corridor and regrouping with Emilia and Beatrice who were waiting for him.
Subaru: [Sorry to keep you waiting. Let’s head out as well.]
Emilia: [Yeah, let’s do that. Will Ram be okay?]
Subaru: [Yeah, most likely; she’s Ram after all, so she’ll be fine… If I’d told her to do something really dumb, there’d be no way she wouldn’t have said anything about it.]
Beatrice: [You’ve gone and put a lot of trust in Ram again, I suppose.]
Subaru: [I trust you just as much, and on top of that, I love you way more. Don’t pout.]
Beatrice puffed out her cheeks as if she were saying: “I’m not pouting, in fact!”. Subaru took her outstretched hand and then looked over at Emilia, standing by his side. He wondered if she was worried about Ram going out on her own; however, her face in profile looked only slightly anxious.
Subaru: [Emilia-tan?]
Emilia: [No, it’s nothing. I just find that reaaaally reassuring.]
Subaru: [――. Coincidence as it may be, I actually feel the same.]
Emilia’s words didn’t really have any foundation to them, but for Subaru her words served as a great boost.
Their expectations far surpassed their anxieties. It was far more reassuring to have someone you could entrust, rather than have someone trusting in you. You could better face up against what lay ahead by believing, rather than clinging. Though it wasn’t like they’d solved any of their problems yet.
Subaru: [It’s only natural to believe in your companions; what’s more, you can believe in yourselves relying on them as well. Now’s the clearest our view’s gotten ever since we came to this sand-filled tower.]
Beatrice: [――That look of yours, it’s my favorite kind of Subaru, I suppose.]
Beatrice looked at Subaru, who’d encouragingly taken over things, and gave him an audacious smile. And then at Beatrice’s comment, Emilia brought a hand to her lips with a “Hehe“, causing Beatrice to point out Emilia’s reaction with a “What’s up with that, in fact.”
Emilia shook her head and then spoke up:
Emilia: [It doesn’t look like you remember, Beatrice, but I was thinking the exact same thing as you.]
△▼△▼△▼△

A huge creature was caught by its hind-legs and savagely swung around before being smashed against the walls and floor without relent.
???: […]
This creature, that was on the receiving end of these monstrous, unfathomable blows let out a hideous wail. A cacophony grated through the air that sounded like the wails of countless babies.
???: [――ϡ ϡ]
What was letting off those wretched cries was a repulsive, bizarre-looking Witchbeast―― One, which in accordance with his own knowledge, Natsuki Subaru had called the Centaur. However, that girl who’d been well acquainted with this kind of Witchbeast had once called it by a different name. ――The Hungry Horse King.
The Hungry Horse King: [――ϡ ϡ]
The Hungry Horse King’s massive body was hurled away, causing it to somersault through the sand-tower’s balcony. Having been knocked about by the impacts, the King of the Sand Sea instantly picked itself back up with flames spewing from its mane.
Its human upper-half brought forth two swords wreathed in flame. Using this completely un-Witchbeastlike dual-wielding sword art, the Horse King tried to fire off a scorching red blow at the being that had been piling on attacks at it.
However…
???: […]
A white ray of light pierced the Hungry Horse King as it tried to swing its swords of flame, its fiery mane billowing. The impact caused this massive creature to falter back a fair few steps. However, it withstood it. It had withstood it. And just like that, the Horse King stepped forward again, preparing to launch its counterattack. ――But the very next moment, the white ray of light exploded inside its body.
The ray of white light turned into a plethora of white rays that shot out of the Horse King in all directions from the inside out
No matter how resilient a creature was, it could not escape death if all of its vital organs were destroyed within. The Hungry Horse King was no exception to this rule as it brutally perished to the white rays of light.
???: […]
The slaughter of the woman who’d been behind its death ― Shaula ― didn’t stop there.
Swinging her braided brown hair about, Shaula powerfully kicked off the floor and leaped across the balcony floor. With light coming from her outstretched hands, she grabbed ahold of two enemies that were obstructing her path ― they were Witchbeasts that had lizard scales over their ape-like bodies. From there, the light coming from her hands welled forth.
If Subaru would have seen her blow, he would have probably dubbed it a Pile Bunker. The heads of the two monkeys she’d grabbed by the face were obliterated by the white light she’d shot, not even giving them a chance to fight back. She followed up by spinning around on the spot and using her long legs to knock down the monkeys that were bounding towards her. Her toes slammed into their faces, whacking them down to the floor with their heads caved in.
The stage where the battle between Shaula and the Witchbeasts was taking place was the fourth floor of the Pleiades Watchtower. Although the outer-wall balcony was built hundreds of metres above the ground, there were quite a few Witchbeasts there that had wings, or could easily climb the wall.
She shot down the ones climbing one by one, the balcony soon becoming a sea of blood.
Shaula: […]
Even after carrying out so much carnage, Shaula wasn’t the least bit out of breath.
The total number of Witchbeasts that were swarming towards the Pleiades Watchtower was so massive, that it’d be pointless to count them. However, the fact that the tower hadn’t succumbed to their avalanche was in no doubt thanks to her overwhelming fighting strength.
Even so, the precarious equilibrium that Shaula was keeping was about to…
???: […Shaula!]
Shaula: [Ghhhhhhhh…!]
A shrill voice called out her name, but she didn’t answer back. With her face contorted in pain, she grabbed a winged Witchbeast that was flying towards her and smashed it down at her feet.
She followed up by piercing it with a white ray of light, giving bloom to flowers of red mid-air, successfully putting an end to its pursuit. However, the state Shaula was in didn’t change as she drove them away. She clutched at her own face and stamped her feet down onto the floor.
Through the gap between her fingers―― Her large-pupiled eyes were beginning to split apart and pulse a brilliant red. Her compound eyes were making their appearance, meaning Shaula was transforming.
Shaula: [Someone… Someone broke a rule…]
With her face covered by the palm of her hands, she met the looming Witchbeasts in this destitute state. She fought off their attacks with her long legs, pulverising their bodies with sharp back-kicks.
???: [This is bad. She’s at her limit. Meili! How’s it looking on your end…]
Meili: [It’s exactly how it looks, I’ve got my ha~nds full dealing with these flying young’uns! If my naked onee-san becomes unable to fight too, we’ll definitely, definitely be running short of ha~nds!]
???: [Guess so. This is looking fairly grim.]
Gazing at Shaula’s anguish, was a girl with wavy light-purple hair sporting a bleak look on her face; Anastasia ― Or rather, Echidna, who was currently borrowing her body. Standing beside her was Meili as well. Her dark blue ponytail was swaying about as she somehow kept the scales tipped in their favour by using her Divine Protection.
The trio of Shaula, Echidna and Meili were the team resisting with all their might to keep the Witchbeasts from approaching the Pleiades Watchtower. However, unlike Meili with her Divine Protection of Magic Manipulation and Shaula with her predisposition for pure firepower, Echidna’s presence was pretty much worthless.
(TL Note: The Wiki translates Meili’s Divine Protection as “Magic Manipulation” but this is a bit literal. The 魔 character in 魔操 is most likely referring to the character in 魔獣 rather than the more generic “magic” or “demon” nuance it has. Translating it in English is tricky due to language limitations, and the fact that everyone but the Anime calls Mabeasts Witchbeasts. I’ve used the Wiki translation for it, but I think there’s a lot of merits to explaining this issue here.)
She was reluctant to go back to Taygeta, but at the same time, she wanted to avoid retreating further into the tower which was in a state of unease, where she’d only end up being an unnecessary burden.
Echidna: [Calm down, now’s not the time for that…]
She moved her slender fingers and focused her awareness at the Od inside her ― Though strictly speaking it was the Od inside Anastasia’s body. Anastasia’s Gate had a defect in it, where it couldn’t take in any mana. That’s why she could only cast magic with her natural Od.
In other words, it was tantamount to cutting Anastasia’s lifespan. Therefore, a measure that not even Echidna wanted to take, other than when her life was truly in danger.
But better to take action than just sit around waiting for death. At least, that’s what the Anastasia she knew would think.
Everyone had to use the cards they were dealt with, and thus, victory was determined by the way you played your cards.
Echidna: […]
The change afflicting Shaula was most likely due to something that was rooted in her core. Something that definitely couldn’t be overturned, existing as a kind of shackle on her. As an Artificial Spirit, Echidna understood that all too well, considering she was in similar shoes. There wasn’t anything anyone could do about one’s force of will.
If what she’d said before was true, then the rules of the Pleiades Watchtower had been broken. She needed to act as the Watchtower’s keeper to remedy that.
The reason she was resisting so hard was because, in the depths of her heart, she didn’t actually want to harm them―― Or rather, she probably didn’t want to harm Natsuki Subaru.
Echidna: […It’s ironic.]
Thanks to her staying on as the keeper of this Watchtower, she’d been able to reunite with the one person she’d wanted to meet. Yet because of her continued presence as its keeper, she couldn’t go against the orders to harm him. ――Truly the sorrow of being a creation.
In its truest sense, Echidna thought that probably only she and Beatrice, with her also being a creation, could comprehend the pain she was in.
That was why she…
???: […DRYHAAAAAAA!!]
Echidna caught a glimpse of the silhouette of a person leaping out from the corridor that led from the balcony to the tower, letting out a vigorous yell. Her eyes mutely widened in surprise, her breath taken away from her.
△▼△▼△▼△
Subaru felt shocked the moment he’d leapt out onto the balcony, witnessing the differences between what it usually looked like and now. He immediately realised that a fierce battle was taking place here.
Subaru: […]
The fourth floor balcony had turned into a sea of blood, with countless Witchbeast cadavers scattered about.
This best seat in the house, where you could enjoy an unbroken view of the sand sea, was now dyed in blood thanks to the countless Witchbeasts ceaselessly charging at it. If left unchecked, they’d get into the tower and mayhem would ensue.
And, the biggest contributor in preventing this damage from spreading was…
Subaru: […Shaula!]
Shaula: [Master…?]
Shaula turned around at the sound of Subaru’s yell ― Her eyes were about to split apart and divide into her six compound eyes; three on the left, three on the right.
He’d already witnessed this transformation process of hers with his own eyes. It meant that the rules of the Pleiades Watchtower had been broken and Shaula’s time had come to take up her duty as the watchtower’s keeper.
This would culminate in Shaula transforming into the giant scorpion against her will, where she’d then set about annihilating the challengers inside the tower ― i.e. Subaru and his group.
That’s why…
Shaula: [Master… Please… Please order me…!]
Subaru: […]
Shaula: [Someone broke the rules. At this rate… Master… I’ll… end up ki…! If you can’t, you know, before I do that, I’ll… I’ll…]
Shaula clutched her body tightly as she sought Subaru’s orders with a look of desperation set on her face.
Her capacity for self-suicide seemed to have been instinctively robbed from her. What she was beseeching for here was one final push to kill her.
Shaula would throw away her life without any hesitation if Subaru were to say it. You could safely say that the threat of the giant scorpion would be gone, so long as he gave the command.
Thus, Subaru nodded his head firmly,
Subaru: [Shaula.]
Shaula: [Y…es… If it’s for you Master, I’ll…]
Subaru: [I’m getting sick of telling you this, but I ain’t got a clue why you’re calling me Master.]
Shaula: [――hk]
The instant Subaru replied back to her, Shaula’s compound eyes became tinged with despair.
After four hundred years of waiting in vain, she’d finally been able to meet him again. But to have that denied by him, and after all that, even have her last wish trampled on, led to her feeling as frightened as a child.
Subaru took a deep breath, and then let it out as he gazed on at her trepidation.
Subaru: [That’s why we’ll talk about whether I’m your Master or not later, as well as if I’ll admit to it.]
Shaula: [Eh…]
Subaru: [I’m not going to tell you to die. There’s no way I’m going to let you keep crying. There’s absolutely no way I’m going to let your four hundred years end here.]
He’d spent quite some time scraping up the “Memories” he’d temporarily lost, so he knew all too well.
The patience people had in this world was insane. Four hundred years they’d spend waiting in earnest for someone. He really needed to drag out these people they wanted to meet, even if it meant grabbing them by the scruff of their necks.
Subaru: [I’ll just do it myself! As if I’m going to willingly do what someone else tells me! Bring it on, oh inevitable fate!]
Shaula: […]
Subaru raised his fist up above him while he firmly declared that, leaving Shaula speechless. Yet at the same time, the unbearable urge going on inside her seemed to be about to burst.
But, at least in that precise moment for her, that which mattered weren’t the rules of the tower or the explosive urge to swell up from within.
Shaula: [Master… I love you.]
Such it would seem were her emotions of uncontrollable love she held for the person she’d longed for all these four hundred years.
Shaula: […]
Shaula’s transformation truly began straight after she’d proclaimed her love.
Her pale, slender hands swelled up, and morphed into giant pincers. Her feminine, voluptuous body burst open, scattering flesh and blood which then formed back, like the rewind on a tape, re-moulding her body anew. A jet-black shell grew there as her bright red compound eyes glared down at the world. Her many legs pierced into the floor, and so the warden of the sand-tower was completed――.
Shaula: [――ϡ ϡ]
The foreboding figure of the giant scorpion let out a shrill warning cry at the rule-breakers who’d violated the tower rules. The first thing its compound eyes settled on was, ironically enough, the black-haired young man that the previous version had obsessed over.
It aimed at him, ready to unleash its devastating blow…
???: [――HIYAAAAAAAA!!]
――Yet a thunderous flying kick drove into the giant scorpion’s body from the side.
The kick carried a tremendous amount of power, enough to lift the giant scorpion’s huge body up from the floor and blow it back. It hurtled across the stone floor, collecting Witchbeasts on its way, before flying off the edge of the balcony out into the skies over the sand sea.
However, the giant scorpion wasn’t going to just do nothing about it. She hurriedly thrust her outstretched stinger into the wall of the watchtower, tossing its massive body up, twisting its body midair as it desperately tried to get back to the balcony.
Subaru: […Murak]
A single chanted word was what prevented it from making its way back.
This direction-imbued mana interfered with the reality around them, bringing about effects into the world that wouldn’t normally occur on their own. This time, its effect had been to block the giant scorpion’s return.
The scorpion was caught by a gust of wind as it desperately tried to land on the balcony. Its body was swept back by the sandy breeze, sending it far off trajectory.
How strong a turbulence would it have to be to blow away the scorpion’s colossal body? It was utterly massive, weighing at least several hundred kilos. Though, things weren’t like it seemed.
Murak was a kind of Yin Magic that changed the gravity of its target.
To put it briefly, it was quite natural that its body had ended up unable to move as it normally did, considering it now weighed as much as a speck of dust. That’s all there was to it.
Shaula: [――ϡ ϡ]
The giant scorpion let out a pained cry before being thrown back once again from the balcony. It quickly swung its stinger in an attempt to snipe those in the tower, having given up on getting back.
But that came a step too late.
Meili: [Hanemogura-chan!]
(TL Note: Hanemogura literally means Winged Mole. I opted to just use the romaji to represent the Witchbeast name like the Wiki does.)
The girl’s imposing command gave way to a rush of blows that hurtled towards the giant scorpion as it blew away in the breeze. Witchbeasts, with what seemed to be bird feathers sprouting from them and most of their heads morphed into a horn, dove towards her.
One by one, they shot themselves straight at the scorpion’s shell. And although they didn’t damage it, they were still able to push her further and further away with each impact, keeping her away from the tower.
Shaula: […]
Even as great of a scorpion as she was, she wasn’t going to be able to shift her body weight around without something to support her. Just like that, after the wind had blown her away, the magic was canceled, making her fall head over heels towards the ground.
They were hundreds of metres up from the ground, but she wasn’t the kind of opponent who’d be done in by something like that. Though, it sufficed as a means for buying time, thus he would make use of this brief reprieve.
Subaru: [Meili! Echidna!]
Echidna: [Natsuki-kun! You’ve pulled yourself together… yeah?]
Echidna looked up with a frown as Subaru rushed over to her. Then with a pensive look adorning Anastasia’s face, she continued her words,
Echidna: [Have you perchance gotten your memories back?]
Subaru: [This is going to save me a lot of time! Though how did you know?]
Echidna: [It’s obvious. Otherwise Beatrice wouldn’t be sporting such a proud look next to you.]
Echidna jerked her chin at Beatrice, who was looking rather smug as she held Subaru’s hand.
Indeed, it was plain as day that Beatrice’s mood had lifted for the better. Plus, the fact that she couldn’t hide this show of emotion of hers was really lovely.
Of course Echidna’s insight was superb as well, make no mistake about that. Following from it, she shifted her gaze to look behind Subaru ― at Emilia ― who’d given the giant scorpion a flying kick earlier.
Echidna: [And this girl I don’t recognise is…?]
Subaru: [It’s due to Gluttony’s authority. She’s a victim to it, just like Julius is… They’re all forgotten, other than by the person themselves. Her name is Emilia. My tough yet adorable princess.]
Echidna: [I appreciate you getting me up to speed so quickly, even so, the tower, both inside and outside, is an utter mess. Would you mind if I were to ask you what we’re going to do about it?]
Subaru: [You can, I’ve already got an answer ready for that.]
Subaru gave her a deep nod. Behind him, Emilia spread her arms out and sent countless shards of ice up into the air. She waited a moment and then unleashed them all, their ferocious power tearing through the Witchbeasts soaring through the skies, as well as those on the ground.
Although Subaru couldn’t see it from where he was, they must have also pierced into the giant scorpion who’d fallen beneath. Yet her attack had only been a drop in the ocean with all these Witchbeasts they had in front of them…
Subaru: [Echidna, you’re going to take over inside! First, you’re going to meet back up with Julius on the second floor where he’s fighting! I’ve told Emilia what to do after that!]
Echidna: [――. I have no issues leaving together with her, but what are you and Beatrice going to do?]
Beatrice: [Our role is already set, in fact.]
Echidna hesitated for a moment before giving her answer. Beatrice replied back to her before raising her eyes up in admiration to look at Subaru’s face in profile, firmly giving his hand a squeeze.
Beatrice: [We’re going to deal with that giant scorpion here, I suppose. We’re going to have to go easy on her, so that we don’t accidentally kill her. Jeez, what a bother, in fact.]
Subaru: [She sure talks big doesn’t she. That’s my Beako for you.]
Beatrice: [Thbptttttttt, I suppose.]
After voicing out her boasts, as if trying to rouse both herself and her contractor, Beatrice stuck her tongue out.
Echidna’s eyes grew wider as she witnessed their exchange, followed by a shake of her head. Rather than wasting time arguing, it’d better for her to believe that this was the best way to go about things, and commit to it.
Indeed, it was so typical of Anastasia to have that instinct that allowed her to make split second decisions.
Echidna: [There’s no doubting that your opinions have come as a great help for us pretty much everywhere inside this tower. That’s why… it seems to me that handing this place over to you would give us our best chances of winning.]
Subaru: [I feel honoured. Though I can’t help but feel bad that you’ve ended up with Echidna’s name.]
Echidna: [Regarding the matter of the deep influence my Creator has, I’d like to find an opportunity to have a proper discussion about this after we settle things. …Is there anything you want me to pass on to Julius?]
Subaru: […]
Echidna tacked that question onto the end, just before she turned her back to leave.
Subaru could still sense Julius fighting a floor above them using the effects of Cor Leonis ― Now that he thought about it, this meant that he’d met back up with all of his friends inside the tower, bar him.
Given that Julius had also been really worried about him when he’d lost his memories, Subaru wondered whether he needed to tell him that he’d gotten them back. However…
Subaru: [Nope, not really.]
He had no words that he needed to tell Julius Euculius who lay locked in combat with Reid Astrea.
After all, Subaru’s plan had been to assign the best people to their most suitable posts amidst this dismal state of affairs. That’s why he’d gone around talking to them, after all he’d needed to reshuffle their roles. However, he didn’t need to do that for Julius.
…Because his post lay nowhere else but against Reid Astrea.
Subaru: [At this point, I can literally only say attaboy to him. He’d still end up going to Reid, even if I didn’t mention anything.]
Thanks to that he’d been able to talk with Shaula before transforming into the giant scorpion.
The familiar words of love she’d uttered in the end had provided Subaru with a boundless strength. A fire had been lit in his heart when he’d told her that he’d definitely, definitely help her.
So, that was why…
Subaru: […Everything I needed to say has already been said by the previous me, as well as the me a little before that. I don’t have anything else to add now. He is Julius Euculius after all.]
Natsuki Subaru fully acknowledged that an unyielding fate existed in this world.
The many problems shrouding the watchtower were impossible to avoid, they would always rear their ugly heads at them. But, being unavoidable and unsurmountable were two completely different stories.
If it was fate for Reid Astrea to stand against Julius, then what came beyond that was also inevitable.
The one who was going to slay Reid Astrea reborn was Julius Euculius.
Echidna: [――. I see. I’ll just tell him as it is then.]
Subaru: [Oh wait, there is something. Since everyone’s having a hard time here, tell him to hurry his ass and settle things there, then come give back up to the others.]
(TL Note: Subaru uses フォロー in this chapter for “help/back up”, which Echidna wouldn’t understand properly since it’s an English loanword. The reason I’ve put a TL note here is because it becomes slightly relevant in the next chapter.)
Subaru waved at Echidna as she began to rush off to her duties with a strained smile on her face. After seeing her off, he turned towards Emilia, who was busy cutting down a pair of Witchbeasts with a sword of ice, over by where Echidna was heading to.
Subaru: [Emilia-tan! It’s going to be just as we discussed! I’m counting on you Emilia-tan!]
Emilia: [Mhm, leave it to me! You’re the one who mustn’t die here Subaru!]
Subaru: [Of course I won’t!]
Emilia’s words were only natural, however, they’d made Subaru raise his fist, feeling more overwhelmed than usual.
He didn’t want to die. ――The reason for that remained unchanged, but now he had more of them why he needed to avoid it at all costs. The dangers of Returning by Death in this situation were nigh unspeakable.
If his restart point hadn’t changed, then he’d go back to the stage before he’d separated Louis Arneb, along with her Witch Factor, from himself. As for what kind of trouble that would bring, neither he, nor anyone else, could know.
Would Louis vanish from Subaru’s body or not? The Hall of Memories lay somewhat out of the normal scheme of things, so he didn’t know whether it would avoid the effects of his Return by Death. Everything was so unclear.
So, that meant…
Subaru: […This time, we’re going to settle things here!]
Following Subaru’s affirmation, Emilia grabbed ahold of Echidna and left the balcony. The girls would be going to their respective field of battle, and likewise, so would Subaru and his group.
Meili: [Wha~t now? All of that sounded like gibberish to m~e, any chance you could explain things to me pro~perly?]
Meili had been patient and not interrupted his conversation with Echidna. But she’d called out to him when she’d noticed that only he and Beatrice had remained on the balcony.
Subaru gave her a thumbs up and flashed her a devilish smile, showing all of his teeth.
There’d been only one reason why Subaru hadn’t called out to Meili in these last moments ― Like Julius, she was already in her ideal field of battle.
Subaru: [I’m sorry Meili, but you’re going to be joining us. Me, you and Beako are going to be holding down two of these corners ― the giant scorpion and the swarm of Witchbeasts!]
Meili: [That’s really not much of an expla~nation!]
Beatrice: […She’s coming, in fact!]
He didn’t have the time to give Meili a more detailed explanation as she gave a swing of her braided hair with a puff of her cheeks. The very next instant, a massive creature jumped up from the outer-wall of the tower, onto the balcony, as if in response to what Beatrice had said.
The creature had a jet-black shell, red compounded eyes and ferocious looking pincers…
Subaru: [So, you’re a four hundred year old hikikomori, yeah?]
Subaru let out a quick sigh before nimbly picking Beatrice up from his side, and snuggling her into his arms. Then, along with Meili who’d rushed over to join them, they came face to face with the giant scorpion.
Faced with their enemy who was still silently glaring at them, he gave a small smile,
Subaru: [This is a hikikomori showdown. Her over there clocks in at four hundred years, whereas us two over here clock in at four hundred and one.]
Meili: [Isn’t four hundred and two more co~rrect when you count all three of us?]
Subaru: [In other words, we’re gonna win!]
Beatrice: [I don’t get what any of this means, other than the part you said about winning, I suppose!!]
Held within his arms, Beatrice shouted at Subaru and Meili for joking about together. And just like that, surrounded by just the right amount of tension, he glared at the giant scorpion and let out a sigh.
Now things had shaped up to become his foreseen match-ups. All that was left now…
Subaru: […I’m seriously counting on you, Emilia-tan. You’re the key to everything.]

…The battle against the Four Corners enclosing the Pleiades Watchtower had officially begun.





"
Chapter 79,“READY STEADY GO”,
Chapter 80,“Death of the Mind”,"ーーIt was the scent of rage.
Fragrant, rich, it was the scent of highly pure rage. Prodigiously churning this slender, petite body, he understood that it would uplift it to greater heights.
Ley: “Haha~ ~tsu!”
Facing each other from the upper and lower ends of the spiral staircase, Batenkaitos laughed with sadness and gloom upon Ram’s caustic remark.
The young girl with potent emotions conceived in her light crimson eyes, breathing in the resentment and hatred she directed towards him, Batenkaitos tasted ecstacy.
Should he state without giving much thought to selecting the wording, saying that this one breath was what he was living for wouldn’t be an exaggeration.
Ley: “How nice, so nice, quite nice, very nice, as it’s nice, isn’t it nice. As there normally aren’t any people who’d face us with such an enraged expression, you see~. It sure is a really valuable feeling, isn’t i~t. Do you understand? We wonder if you do understa~nd, the delight which we’re feeling right now!”
Stepping on the ground upon expressing the vivifying emotion, Batenkaitos licked his lips.
Yes, this emotion and encounter, was something Batenkaitos normally couldn’t ever hope for.
The『Memories』and『Names』stolen through the Authority of『Gluttony』got disengaged from the world, and with the exception of Roy and Louis, it became impossible for anyone to even be cognizant of them.
The grief of having lost someone precious, the rage of hiestation, the hollow sense of loss, anything and everything got evanesced entirely, beyond all help.
Ley: “So naturally, that’s a matter of course. That’s why, we’ve never minded it, you see~.”
Whenever he operated as a member of the much-loathed Witch Cult, on copious occasions would he meet humans who directed their hatred towards his affiliation. However, never had there been one who knew of Ley Batenkaitos’ deeds, who harboured hatred for Ley Batenkaitos individually, who aimed to kill Ley Batenkaitos specifically.
That natural divine providence brought forth by the Authority of『Gluttony』, that obvious unwritten law, had been overruled.
ーーWith the emergence of an outsider, who did not sustain the effects of the Authority of『Gluttony』.
Ley: “Natsuki Subaru…… ~tsu!”
Whispering the name of the man Louis had been attached to, Batenkaitos attained a sweet ache in the depths of his slim chest. It was not as if he had taken influence by Louis. He had known about him, even prior to that.
He had been thinking of him, powerfully, profoundly, far earlier than even Louis.
That beingーー,
Ley: “ーーNee-sama, will also understand, ri~ght?”
The connection between the origin of this sweet ache in his chest, and the young girl looking down towards him was deep. ーーNo, not merely deep. Two hearts that beat as one, irreplaceable individuals, saying that they were the other halves of each other would be unobjectionable as well.
Thus, she would surely understand. These sweet, fleeting, far too mighty emotions. This sensation, blended with both love and hate, and the ache within the chest longing for release.
That is why, he addressed with half of his mouth open, pouring in that conviction and expectationーー,
Ram: “Ram’s already told you. ーーTo kindly die whilst baying like a pig.”
Ley: “ーー~hk!”
The subsequent instant, Ram’s first move as she flew down after kicking the staircase, made Ley jump far backwards.
He had narrowly managed to draw his body back, but the fine point of the wand being pointed out was accurately aiming for his right eye. Should he be slow in pulling back his head, it shall ransack his brain through the eyeball.
Ley: “Geez, nee-sama is mercile~ss! Had we eaten this one just now, forget about imitating the bay of a pig, we would’ve died unable to do anything ~tsu!”
Ram: “Ram has reconsidered. If you were made to imitate something below the standard of a pig, then it’ll surely be a real affront for the pig as well.”
Flying through the spiral staircase, his landing was delayed solely due to the difference in the levels of stairs. Whilst apprising her chilling intent to kill, Ram’s furious assault waged a pursuit of fierce vigour towards Batenkaitos.
Whilst gyrating her slim figure, Ram pointed out her wand, fired a kick, drilled in a shot of the elbow. Batenkaitos dodged them entirely through the handling of his body, but things like the hit which had grazed past his ear certainly possessed the vigour that upon a single hit, would certainly lead to loss of faculty of that part of the body.
Ley: “Haha ~tsu! Scary scary! It’s scary though you kno~w!”
Batenkaitos laughed whilst using his body to evade the unhesitating strikes in pursuit of him. That wasn’t flexibility, but exaltation. ーーNo, slight flexibility as well.
Ram’s martial arts were quite something. Lacking all forgiveness, she possessed no faltering in her aim to kill. Yet, Batenkaitos dodged with leisure and ease. The reason for that was quite simple.
Ley: “We already pro~perly know, that nee-sama is more amazing, you see~.”
The multitude of『Memories』terminated and packed together within Batenkaitos. Within them was a passionate one which adored Ram as an elder sister, which yearned for her infinite potential.
The untiring trust and expectation towards Ram which those『Memories』were endowed with, conveyed their contrast with the Ram before his eyes, nearly to a sorrowful extent, to Batenkaitos.
To summarizeーー,
Ley: “ーーNee-sama without her horn, is nothing but a counterfeit which even Rem can substitute for, isn’t that ri~ght.”
Ram: “ーーーー”
Ley: “Ah, did you get angry? Have you gotten angry? If you want to get angry then you can get angry perfectly fine, nee-sama. Now that we think of it, we’ve never even had a proper sisterly quarrel before, you kno~w.”
Batenkaitos set forth the reminiscences as if a belonging of his own. Though Ram’s cheeks stiffened in reaction to his speech and conduct, her attacks did not slacken.
Batenkaitos admiringly thought within his innermost heart, that she was really quite pushing herself. It was famously known that Onis who lost their horns lost their bodily control, though it was unclear how much anguish it entailed. Ram had also been continually tormented due to that penalty.
It was unknown just how many times the thought of wanting to take over her pain had come to mind.
However, alongside that also came another thought. ーーThat oneself wouldn’t be able to endure the anguish she bore.
If the agony of losing the horn depended on the strength that Oni originally possessed, then Ram must have the greatest in that regard, which no other Oni in the world could share.
Thus, commendation to her onrushing form by way of her own determination, through that compelling anguish. And, gratitude to her earnest wolfing stance, with an unruffled facial expression.
With the ripening of the greatest, supreme, premier flavour, to simply whom should he express his delight for being witness to the moment the rich aroma arose, he did not know.
ーーHe hailed gratitude and admiration, toward the miracle of happening across this gourmet delicacy.
Ley: “Truly ~tsu! Nee-sama is so wonderful ~tsu!!”
A murderous dance blended with love and hate unfolded on the spiral staircase. Whilst tasting that to his heart’s content, Batenkaitos blessed Ram’s existence.
And, tilting his body, turning over, stooping down, dodging as per the『Memories』craved,
Ley: “Now with a ta da, time for a counterattaーー”
Ram: “How truly noisy.”
Surrounding Ram whilst she pointed out her wand, Batenkaitos aimed for her fair neck. His side which had gotten into her undisputable blind spot, and Ram’s line of sight entangled when she turned around.
At that single moment, feeling intimidated, Batenkaitos interrupted the strike and flew in evasion and escaped. However, the instant after wind grazed past his right cheek, he felt blood starting to drip out.
Ley: “ーー~tsu.”
Tracing his cut cheek with his hand, Batenkaitos inhaled faintly.
It was a wound he wasn’t supposed to sustain. At the very least, the『Memories』present within Batenkaitosーー if he were to abide by the existence who best knew the prodigy Ram, then there didn’t exist a future where he should’ve sustained this wound.
Yetーー,
Ram: “Though Ram told you to bay disgracefully, an unsightly opponent’s voice is also rough to hear. Ram doesn’t intend to keep you company any longer, so you’re getting killed.”
Ley: “Nee-sama, this is……”
Ram: “If you had been evaluating Ram relying on the『Memories』, then your evaluation is yet too naive.”
Looking at Batenkaitos after he stained his cheek with blood by his hand, Ram gently brushed her pink hair. With her dreadfully cold sidelong glance towards this side,
Ram: “Were you intending to bring out Ram’s true colours? If that’s the case then that is quite laughable. ーーRam’s potential is infinite. After all”
Ley: “ーーーー”
Ram: “ーーRam is, Rem’s nee-sama.”
A baseless, careless remark, the reason why it echoed with such extraordinary convincibility was because that is how the『Memories』, present within nobody but Batenkaitos, had captured the existence of their elder sister.
Recognising that reality, Batenkaitos erased his smile and distorted his cheeks in annoyance.
Boring. Uninteresting. She doesn’t get it.
Ley: “Both rage and hatred, are spices for enhancing flavours. But, if the taste of the spices is too strong, if it asserts itself too powerfully, then even that platter goes to waste. Guess nee-sama, who doesn’t cook, would be completely clueless about these customs, hu~h?”
Ram: “That’s not true. There’s nothing to hide, Ram’s special dish is steamed potatoes after all.”
The『Memories』which had vivid recollection of that resuscitated, and his stomach growled.
Intentionally ignoring that call of the sense of emptiness and hunger in his stomach, Batenkaitos casted his mood to play around aside.
Ram was still yet to demonstrate the true worth of her strength. In other words, that meant naught but that she hadn’t revealed everything even to the younger sister who was physically quite similar to her.
In other wordsーー,
Ley: “ーーNee-sama, won’t trust even her little sister, talk about the ultimate individualism, isn’t i~t.”
Ram: “……What a superficial way of understanding things. Ram doesn’t know how many human lives you have tasted, but even those people don’t come to mind. Everything aside from Rem is trifle.”
Repudiating Batenkaitos’ outlook on meals, Ram straitened her light crimson eyes.
And, whilst caressing her own slim chest,
Ram: “Kindly exert yourself as much as you can, Barusu.”
Calling out to the young boy not present here, extraordinary determination levitated across her cold expression.
Ram: “Though something like collective destiny, makes one shiver.”

△▼△▼△▼△

He took a deep inhale, with a cloth covering his mouth protecting him from swallowing the sand.
If he were to be honest then he would’ve preferred to have goggles as well, but that would be a hope too high. Prepared to have grains of sand fly into his eyeballs, he had no choice but simply be careful about his eyes within the vortex of the sandy whirlwind.
Subaru: “Beako! Meili! We’ve gotta pull through!”
Beatrice: “Betty knows, in fact!”
Meili: “Geez, you really don’t know how to treat people~!”
The one traversing through his field of vision blurred by the sand, was a fiendish existence clad in a jet black shell.
Approaching closer, and taking a single attack by its great pincers meant forfeiting life. Taking distance, and should it succeed in its efforts to fire its tail stinger meant forfeiting life. There were multiple other conditions of forfeiting life as well.
In terms of simply conditions of defeat, there existed more than plenty, that is what their situation was presently.
Subaru: “With that being said, that’s what always happens……!”
Natsuki Subaru’s battles were a series of continued tightrope walks.
The reason why he suffocated despite knowing the future through『Return by Death』was because of the abilities he could possess, and the sheer magnitude of the enemies he confronted never allowed him to counterbalance.
Lacking cards to play was his omnipresent scenario. Whilst trusting everyone’s strength, expecting that they’d adapt to the situations’ requirements and fight, Subaru himself struggled hard, a befitting answer to everyone’s expectations of him.
Subaru: “Rather than a fight of my own, this, is a fight of my wonderful comrades!”
Meili: “Is this really the situation to say tha~t!? Geez! Do your best, Hungry Horse King-chan!”
Receiving Subaru’s baloneous yell, Meili, who was racing right next to him, issued orders to the Witch Beastsーー Hungry Horse Kings.
The Witch Beasts akin to centaurs screeched like the cry of a child, and two of them carrying Subaru and Beatrice, and Meili respectively rushed through the sea of sand.
And, the one in pursuit of their backs as they fiercely kicked the sand, was the titanic scorpion as it scratched the sand with its several legs and gave a rise to a cloud of dust, resuming its hounding.
“ーー~Bishaaan!”
Just as his instinct had told him earlier, should they distance themselves then the tail stinger, should they approach closer then the enormous pincers, shall come for their lives. Whilst keeping a distance neither too close nor too far, they coped with the enemy’s attacks.
Compared to the conditions of defeat he had listed, the sole condition for victory permitted to them was a change at the extremity of stalemate. It referred to Emilia capturing the first layer of the tower, and the rewriting of the cited rules.
As a matter of fact, he hadn’t even confirmed whether that was an actual possibilityーー,
Beatrice: “If that’s not possible, then it’ll be strange to have that included in the tower’s rules in the first place, I suppose.”
Subaru: “Exactly, Beako. Going out of their way and having “you can also destroy the rules” included in the rules means that the rules are premised on the fact that they’ll be destroyed.”
And if that was a possibility, then it was perhaps a reward given to the one who captured the tower. Should that be considered, then it was a right given only to the one who had cleared everything with proper means.
It was an immense relief that Emilia had entirely broken through Reid. Had she not been victorious, then the means to save Shaula perhaps wouldn’t have even grazed past his hands.
Subaru: “Though I’ll never forgive him for sexually harassing Emilia-tan……!”
Though it was a happening infuriating to even look back on, Julius had been charged with retribution when it came to Reid.
Expecting that he shall fully overwhelm that violent man, Subaru caught the enormous sand tower within his field of vision and entrusted himself to the fierce struggle Beatrice and Meili were putting up.
Meili: “Onii-san! It isn’t easy to move around in this spot! I think it’ll be easier for the Witch Beast-chan’s to rampage about in a place further away from the towe~r!?”
Subaru: “Gh……! I get what you’re saying! I get it but, no! I won’t get away from the tower. If I get any further away, then I’ll lose grasp!”
Rejecting Meili’s appeal, Subaru gnashed his molars whilst grabbing his chest.『Cor Leonis’』efficacy resumed, and the locations of his comrades within the tower were still within his sphere of grasp, in the form of fleeting lights. However, he did not know for what possible cause this Authority, with yet far too many uncertain facets, may come undone.
In terms of the Authority’s efficiency, what was the easiest to perceive was indeed distance.
In reality, Subaru did not know the locations of his comrades outside of the Augria Sand Dunes. If that was due to distance, then it was unknown how far he could get away from the tower.
He was afraid of losing the ability to confirm the locations as well as the well-being of his comrades.
However, the greatest issue was not their well-being but losing the ability to shoulder their burden. It was a matter of course that Emilia or Julius had exposed their bodies to grave battles, but what further had an eagle grip on Subaru’s heart was Ram, who was out for vengeance.
“ーーーー”
Though he was confident that he had deployed his comrades to their respective utmost suitable positions, he had anticipated from the very beginning that even amongst them all, Ram’s fight would become particularly dire. That’s because her opponent was Ley Batenkaitosーー the originator of turning Rem into a『Sleeping Beauty』, and Ram’s own condition.
Ram must be in perfect shape and form, otherwise she shan’t be able to oppose Ley Batenkaitos.
On top of that, he wished for Ram to beat Batenkaitos down to her heart’s content. For that purpose, Subaru was required to shoulder the burden she consistently suffered.
That is precisely whyーー,
Subaru: “I can’t just thoughtlessly get away from the tower! Sorry for being a handicap, but please compromise!”
Meili: “hk! This is, absolutely definitely going to come back to bite you later!”
Rounding her lips upon Subaru’s call, Meili shouted with a red face atop of the Hungry Horse King’s back.
At the same pace, the young girl glared towards the sky and clapped her hands towards the existences circling around in the blue, cloudless sky.
Meili: “Winged Mole-chan’s! It’s show ti~me!”
Receiving the shrill command, the tiny shadows soaring in the sky swooped down towards the sand sea. Seeing they were aiming for the titanic scorpion atop the sand, Subaru instantly shouted “Beako!”
Subaru: “Match in with them!”
Beatrice: “Betty knows, in fact! “Vita”!!”
Presuming Subaru’s aim, Beatrice put up her tiny palm towards the sky.
The chant’s effect was invoked, however, the aim wasn’t towards the titanic scorpion, but towards the Winged Moles which had their eyes set on the titanic scorpion.
In the course of the descending Winged Moles, there was a loop of pale light producedーー the moment the Winged Moles passed through that loop, the small-sized Witch Beasts accelerated, clad in light.
“ーーーー”
The piercing strike drilled into the outer shell of the titanic scorpion, giving rise to a violent note.
The titanic scorpion, which had been accepting the battlecries of the Winged Moles like gentle breeze until now, stopped its multiple legs upon the direct hit possessing unignorable might.
Meili: “What was that, just now…… Beatrice-chan, what did you do?”
Beatrice: “Made your Witch Beasts heavy right before they collided, I suppose. Their speed or solidity won’t change, but the result changes with a simple increase in weight, in fact.”
Beatrice responded to Meili’s astonishment.
That was the answer to the reason behind the sudden enhancement of the Winged Moles. ーーStrength was a mix of weight and velocity.
Winged Moles navigated underground using their potent horns, the risky assault of the Witch Beasts which flew about in the sky and the underground at will decisively halted the steps of the titanic scorpion with unbelievable destructiveness.
The titanic scorpion’s defensive capability was quite impressive, but it wasn’t able to completely defend an attack it was witnessing for the first time. And, in order to surpass that reflective defence capability, Subaru fully rotated his head.
Subaru: “I feel bad for the Witch Beasts, but it’s a trade-off between life and time. There’s plenty of quantity and varieties of Witch Beasts that can be used, with Beako’s assistance the possibilities are infinite……! This wayーー”
They can succeed, that definite response made Subaru clench his fist and Beatrice’s hair. Beatrice raised her voice in protest, saying “It hurts, I suppose!”. ーーThat was the instant.
Subaru: “ーーAh?”
With the plan to buy as much time as possible, Subaru spilled out a voice whilst looking up towards the watchtower.
Hearing his vacant voice, Beatrice turned around saying “Subaru?”, but he remained unable to respond.
What was brought to Subaru’s consciousness, was not the visible exterior of the watchtower, but its interiorーー the interior of the tower whereby he could sense fleeting lights at various locations, the reason was the responses of his comrades.
Likely, it appeared each one of them must be engaged in vehement battles, amongst them a single one’s response vanished. ーーThe response of Emilia, who was heading to the top.
“ーーーー”
That moment, Subaru’s heart throbbed so intensely as if it had come detached.
The reality that Emilia’s response had vanished threw Subaru into a state of chaos. What if, within the couple of moments just now, Emilia had been lostーー,
Subaru: “ーー~hk, Calm down, bloody bastard.”
He halted his vision from blackening through a reprimand of his own.
This was far too early to despair about the reality. He needed to trust『Cor Leonis’』ability more. Though its origin was from the worst kind of a man, but now that it had blossomed, this Authority was an ally.
Based on the responses of『Cor Leonis』until now, it could be assumed that the intensity of the fleeting lights’ warmth and movement conveyed the status of his allies.
When they became violently worked up, the colours or intensity of the lights changed.
Then, did the disappearance of Emilia’s response refer to her『Death』.
Subaru: “If that’s the case, then the rate at which the response disappeared happened way too instantly.”
If it were to be assumed that Emilia encountered an enemy so fearsome it was able to extinguish her existence in a single instant, even if she had fallen into its hands, he couldn’t imagine her being taken out without resistance.
He couldn’t imagine, neither did he want to. He had belief. That’s why, the problem perhaps lied somewhere else.
Rushing up the watchtower, Emilia had headed for the first layer, and something had happened which made her body go out of the range of『Cor Leonis’』influence.
Thus, in but a single instant, Emilia’s response disappeared from Subaru’s perception.
He must believe so, otherwiseーー,
Beatrice: “Subaru!”
Meili: “Onii-san! This is no time to space ou~t!”
Gnashing his molars and gums, Subaru kept himself in check through pain as the two young ladies called out to him.
Hearing them, Subaru responded with “I know” such that both himself and they could hear it,
Subaru: “I have no idea, whom she may have to confront and where. But I believe, that she will make her way back.”

△▼△▼△▼△

ーーAt the same time as when Subaru had pronounced words of prayer, far below on the sand.
Though Subaru said that he did not know whom she may have to confront, there was no way that even Subaru’s imagination could’ve predicted the situation Emilia had been placed in.
Abiding by Subaru’s command, Emilia had headed to the first layer in order to rewrite the rules of Pleiades Watchtowerーー what she encountered was a blue, shimmering, gargantuan existence clad in scales.
An existence whose name, nobody was unaware of in this Kingdom of Lugnicaーー no, in the entire world.
If the『Witch of Envy』was regarded as the symbol of fear, then it was the befitting symbol of hope and faith. For this existence had continued to accumulate meritorious deeds of such scale for the world.
The name of that gargantuan and great existenceーー,
Emilia: “ーー『Divine Dragon』Volcanica.”
Ruminating the name it had given for itself, Emilia felt her entire body colden.
Though a strange thing to say, Emilia’s predisposition was entirely detached from nervousness. Though of course she felt her body be heavier when she had to stand in front of people or when she had to talk about something crucial, but upon undertaking practical action she immediately forgot about their effects.
On multiple occasions she had been praised by Subaru or Ram for having that impressive quality.
However, despite possessing that impressive quality, Emilia’s physical movement ceased completely before the『Divine Dragon』.
Such that she felt she couldn’t take even a single breath without the opponent’s permission. To such an extent, the presence of the true dragon was projected, and had its grasp on the world.
“ーーーー”
Whilst inhaling, Emilia once again glanced at Volcanica’s frame.
Scales with a deep tinge of blue were shimmering like jewels, and every single one of them appeared to have been tempered thoroughly, as if sharper than any treasured sword.
Its forelimbs and hindlimbs were endowed with black claws akin to stone, its face, similar to that of a Ground Dragon, gave the impression of having lived for long, and a pair of golden eyes that had witnessed an unfathomable amount of time. On its head were two enormous horns, white like a noble’s milk.
The『Divine Dragon’s』stature was likely about fifteen or sixteen metres in height. Since it wasn’t standing, had its wings and tail folded, its exact enormity couldn’t be determined. But despite that it was this gargantuan, a matter of course that it couldn’t be fit inside the tower.
It was unquestionable that the first layer had been constructed in an open location because of Volcanica.
Emilia: “……The third layer was the『Sage』, the second layer was Reid, and the first layer is Volcanica.”
Volcanica: [ーーーー]
Emilia: “Could it be, that all three heroes of the great antiquity, are involved in the tower’s『Trials』?”
Looking back onto the『Trials』until how, Emilia discovered a similitude between them.
『The Three Heroes』ーー they had formerly made efforts in the sealing of the『Witch of Envy』, and were three heroic figures engraved into the history of the Kingdom of Lugnica. Those being Shaula, Reid, and Volcanica.
Furthermore, Shaula had stated that it was actually an achievement of Flugel’s, Reid was incredibly violent and talked crudely, and Volcanica was not a person but a dragon.
But if they were yet connected in this place, thenーー,
Emilia: “To still be friends after so many centuries, that’s rea~lly wonderful.”
Emilia thought it was a very wonderful thing if something like commitment or unity, had tied the three heroic figures together.
On top of that, Volcanica was the existence who had pledged a covenant with the Kingdom of Lugnica, and as a matter of fact, when a black dragon had been rampaging within the Kingdom of Lugnica multiple decades ago, it had been recorded that it possessed extraordinary power.
Emilia, loved those who viewed promises as important.
She believed that upholding promises was a very nice thing. She cherished Subaru and trusted him, but she believed his characteristic of not upholding promises was no good.
What if Beatrice started imitating him.
Neither did Emilia wish to scold Subaru and Beatrice for breaking promises.
Emilia: “Ah, woops. This is no time to be thinking all that…… Um, Volcanica! I came here to take the『Trial』! The『Trial』of the first layer! I’ll tackle it!”
Volcanica: [ーーーー]
Emilia: “I don’t know how tough a『Trial』it will be…… but, I ask of you to hurry! I must hurry or Subaru and the others will be in trouble. Whatever it may be, bring it on!”
Striking her cheeks with her hands, Emilia reorganized her cowering emotions.
Without even planning so, thinking about Subaru and Beatrice made the root for that. Even if they were to be scolded by Emilia for breaking promises, that was speaking of a distant tomorrow, a distant future.
In order to come face to face with that future, Emilia needed to stand firm here.
Volcanica: [ーーーー]
The silent『Divine Dragon』was intently watching Emilia with its golden hued eyes.
Speaking without exaggeration, those eyes felt deep enough to absorb her entirely.
It had fought the『Witch of Envy』, and forged the covenant with the Kingdom of Lugnica four hundred years agoーー but, the time this great dragon had lived through appeared to be far greater than those four hundred years.
Those eyes, perhaps close to reaching a thousand years of age, were intently gazing upon the world.
It was unknown in what way would Emilia’s existence be projected, to this『Divine Dragon』.
Emilia: “I, am used to being judged. There are people who hate me because I’m a half elf, or meanies like Echidna…… but, like Subaru, Ram or Beatrice and everyone else, there are also people who have laid their expectations on me.”
Whilst addressing, Emilia touched the crystal on her chest with her fingers.
Her family, who was yet asleep, was the first one to affirm Emilia, who largely looked through rose-coloured glasses like this.
With that family of her’s as the beginning, in this tower were her comrades who had accepted Emilia.
Emilia: “That’s why, I don’t care no matter how you look at me!”
Before the『Divine Dragon』she had been overawed by once, Emilia declared sharply.
Even the existence known as Emilia, who had been crushed by the contrast in presence, whose limbs had been quivering and cowering, who had been overwhelmed by the existence acquainted to eternity, shall no longer lose.
ーーNo matter what, she shan’t lose.
Volcanica: [ーーーー]
Emilia strengthened her fist and made her amethyst eyes glitter with might.
Whilst being showered with Emilia’s gaze throughout its entire body, Volcanica slowly blinked. Afterwards, Volcanica moved its dragon jaws with grandeurーー,
Volcanica: [ーーThou, who hath reached the top of the tower. Step forth through the first floor, almighty petitioner.]
“ーーーー”
Volcanica: [ーーI, am Volcanica. In accordance with the ancient covenant, I ask the will of thee who hath reached the summit.]
Emilia: “……Huh?”
Emilia, who had packed her breath and put herself on guard for the challenge Volcanica may ask her of, heard the cumbrous words accompanying the dragon breath and tilted her head.
For she had remembrance of these words.
Emilia: “Um, hadn’t you told me about that earlier? That I am the one who arrived at the first layer, and that you are Volcanica…… is that right?”
Volcanica: [ーーーー]
Emilia: “……Ah! Did I not introduce myself, by chance? I apologize. I am Emilia, just Emilia. Well, there’s many people right now who don’t remember me, so it’ll be a problem if you ask me to prove it, but, I’m Emilia!”
Volcanica: [ーーーー]
Emilia: “……Still, no good?”
Thinking whether her omitting her introduction had brought its displeasure, she reintroduced herself yet no positive change was born in Volcanica’s response.
Had Subaru been here, he would’ve gone so far and thought that skipping introduction led to the revocation of the right to take the『Trial』of the first layer, but Emilia did not think that way.
Emilia believed that even if a mistake was made, upon apologizing the opponent couldn’t continue being so heartless.
Thus, even at this instant she did not believe her impoliteness had bought Volcanica’s silence.
What Emilia had thought of, was the possibility that Volcanica was not angry. But even if that were to be the case, it might’ve been much worse than simply being angered.
After allーー,
Emilia: “Could it be……”
Gazing back into its golden eyes, Emilia timidly moved forward.
One step, two steps, resuming her walk in a place close to the sky, she shortened the distance between herself and the『Divine Dragon』Volcanica. Emilia inched closer, as it breathed, that too with magnificence.
And, gently stretching her hand forward, she touched the scales of the opponent’s front leg.
Emilia: “ーーCold.”
The scales she touched were cold like ice, or like steel which had cooled down.
Just how long a duration would one need to remain stagnated, to lose this much heat.
It did not mean biological『Death』. Those who remained stagnated for a long duration, simply lost bodily energy.
Volcanica: [ーーThou, who hath reached the top of the tower. Step forth through the first floor, almighty petitioner.]
“ーーーー”
Volcanica: [ーーI, am Volcanica. In accordance with the ancient covenant, I ask the will of thee who hath reached the summit.]
Whilst gazing down upon Emilia who was touching its foreleg, Volcanica repeated once again.
Words of reception that had been repeated and stockpiled exactly thrice. They were not with the purpose of condemning the mistake Emilia made with her greeting.
Volcanica’s eyes, which were profoundly staring at Emilia, were reflecting her as if not reflecting her.
Its reason was apparent.
Emilia: “Could it be, you became such an old uncle that you forgot about the『Trial』……?”
Not the『Death』of the body, but the『Death』of the mind had hunted the long-lived dragon.
And for Emilia, who must clear the『Trial』of the first layer, it befell as a challenge beyond the『Trial』of the first layer.
The great library of Pleiades, the trial of the first layer of『Maia』.
The time limit,『The Time For The Survival Of Her Comrades』. Number of challenges,『Unknown』. Number of challengers,『One』.『Content Of The Trial』, unknown.
ーーTrial, begin.
