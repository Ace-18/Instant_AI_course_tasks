Chapter Number,Chapter NamePART1
Chapter 71,“Count One”,"ーーWith his final words washed away by the wind, Natsuki Subaru’s consciousness came to an end.
“ーーーー”
Speaking of irony, ironically enough, his『Death』this time had been a『Death』by his own volition.
Perhaps that is why his mind and heart had remained calm at the moment of『Death』ーー of course, that had not been the case, he had possessed uneasiness and nervousness for jumping into the circumstance of『Death』on his own accord.
However, unlike till now, he had faced the『Death』he had anticipated with much more sincerity than his other『Deaths』up to this time.
Of course, he did not believe that him choosing to die had truly saved Shaula.
She did not want to kill him, so she wanted him to command her to die.
Shaula, who had been concerned about Subaru to that extent, had let Subaru throw himself to his death right in front of her eyes. The weight of that impact he did not know and it must have​ immensely shattered her heart, which had continued awaiting for four hundred years.
That is why, this was nothing more than Subaru’s self-satisfaction. The worst kind of self-satisfaction of exaggerating and not seeing the result for himself with his own eyes.
Howeverーー,
Subaru: “ーーSo what.”
If all that is fastened to him was nothing but self-satisfaction, nothing but hypocrisy, what was wrong with that.
In the end, the method to catch and halt the impact of all happenings in this world could only be wielded in one’s own weighing scales. Unaccomplished good deeds hold no meaning, and the word known as hypocrisy doesn’t ultimately exist.
ーーAll of them, surviving.
After his discussion with Shaula, Subaru cemented the final objective he had touted.
ーーNo, to be precise, the survival of all of them had been his goal from the beginning. That judgement had merely decided whether to include Shaula in that or not, and Subaru chose to love all of them.
He shall lead the way to solve all of the catastrophes surrounding this sand tower.
For that purpose, he would do anything he could.
That isーー,
Subaru: “The meaning, behind why I am myself. ーーIsn’t that so, 『Natsuki Subaru』.”
Along with that instantaneous decision, he awakened from the deep, deep abyss of『Death』ーー.

"
Chapter 72,“■■・■”,"ーーUpon the advent of unforeseen『Death』, Natsuki Subaru heard the sound of ■ cracking.
However, upon each instance of that inexorable sound, he thought.
That it was certainly the proof of his progress not having come to a halt. That it was, the footsteps of the approaching future.
No matter how small those steps were, no matter how trifling the path he had advanced upon was, he was certainly, walking and progressing.
???: “ーーSubaru.”
“ーーーー”
The moment his consciousness was led to awakening, blue eyes of a characteristic pattern were reflected into his own. In front of his eyes, peeping at Subaru worriedly was Beatrice.
Beatrice’s hand was gently placed at Subaru’s cheek, and Subaru inhaled.
He had parted with Beatrice’s crying face not too long ago.
That consciousness’ switchover had not been carried out well. Just previously, though it could not be associated with something as extravagant as a parting, she certainly had been in Subaru’s eyes.
Subaru: “……Ah.”
Beatrice: “Is your consciousness firm, I suppose? It took time for you to wake up till now, it was worrying, in fact. It would be better to confirm you did not lose any memories accidentally, I suppose. To start with, Betty, do you recall who……”
Subaru: “Bea, trice……”
Beatrice: “ーー. It seems you do properly remember, in fact. Good boy good boy, I suppose.”
Saying that, Beatrice stretched the hand she had at Subaru’s cheek towards his head. At the same pace, she patted him with her tiny palm and slowly​, his consciousness caught up to reality.
Subaru: “Count, one huh……”
“ーー?”
Beatrice tilted her head upon the whispering voice.
However, neither did she know what it meant, nor did he intend to explain it. She might not understand even if he were to explain, and he did not intend to make her understand either.
She was kind. Beatrice, was extremely kind.
That is why, what Subaru​ was testing out. If he were to tell her about that, it was a given that she would be absolutely against it. ーーThat was, something which Beatrice must not be allowed to know.
Beatrice: “So, how did it go, in fact? Was the purpose of reading the book fulfilled, I suppose?”
Subaru: “ーーYeah, about that.”
That is what Beatrice asked Subaru, who still had the book placed on his knees.
The moment immediately before the immediately previous momentーー the moment immediately before Subaru had disregarded his own physical state, Subaru had just been seeking a way to capture『Reid Astrea』and was just about to read his『Book of the Dead』.
That had come to a standstill due to complicated reasons, and multitudes of situations got caught in between the interval such that that would feel as if it was quite an old topicーー though that went only for Subaru, at maximum.
Things he ought to do, things he must do, they had all been decided.
That is whyーー,
Subaru: “Beatrice, it’ll be getting​ a bit confusing. ーーLend me, your strength.”
Beatrice: “ーー. That is a given, in fact. Betty is Subaru’s partner, I suppose.”
Promised Beatrice to Subaru, who had broken the ice without any explanations.
Her existence was, truly, very truly, reassuring for the ■.

"
Chapter 73,” “Natsuki Subaru” “,"ーーWith the 『Book of the Dead』 which had 『Natsuki Subaru』 inscribed on it in his hands, he stood still.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

Widening his dark eyes in astonishment, Subaru felt his throat rapidly turning parched.
Modest expressions such as astonishing or stupefying would be far too lacking. What had struck Subaru at that moment was something much more serious, something as if numbing harm.
A lethal toxic which would wield affect only when used on Subaru, and nobody elseーー.

The 『Book of the Dead』 of 『Natsuki Subaru』, was piercing through Subaru whilst commanding such powerful connotation.

Subaru: “Wh, y……”

So, the 『Book of the Dead』 not supposed to be here was present here.
What was supposed to be present in the third layer of Pleiades Watchtower, 『Taygeta』 were the 『Books of the Dead』 recording the lives of the departed. Having the book of a living being was contradictory.
Or perhaps, could this mean he simply, by chance, had found the book of a human with the same name and surname.

Subaru: “That would have actually been convincing, had this not been a different world……”

The possibility that rose to the surface in his mind, was instantly repudiated.
Though it was a matter of course, this place was a different worldーー in this place, where even the rules of naming would be vastly different from what Subaru was aware of, why would a name like 『Natsuki Subaru』 take birth here.
Even before that, there lay a decisive issue.

The title of that book of 『Natsuki Subaru』, had been written in Kanji.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

From what all Subaru had witnessed till now, even letters were disparate in this different world. That is why, even if someone else, aside from Subaru, who did not know of the world’s letters were to see it, they would probably perceive this title as if being hieroglyphic characters or something of that sort.
If that were to be considered, the unbelievable chances of Subaru finding the 『Book of the Dead』 of 『Natsuki Subaru』 here through sheer luck wereーー,

Subaru: “ーーIt’s predetermined and established, whom this belongs to.”

He could only think of that being true.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

Once again, with the 『Book of the Dead』 in his hands, Subaru silenced himself and pondered.
The reason why Subaru happened upon this 『Book of the Dead』, was because he had depended upon the dim response he had spied out through 『Cor Leonis』.
This had not been the first or second time he had searched for a book in the library, though Subaru was mindful of it, discovering the book being aimed for in this enormous archive was a deed next to impossible to achieve.
Perhaps, the kind unattainable unless god’s invisible hand was being put to work.

Subaru: “Or perhaps, not god, but someone’s……”

Subaru convicted, as if having anticipated that.
The rest lay, in the authenticity of this 『Book of the Dead』ーー whether what was depicted here, was truly the life of 『Natsuki Subaru』 or not. If it was depicted indeed, then what sort of a trick was behind it.
As the solemn truth, Subaru was here, alive.
If the 『Book of the Dead』 of this Subaru was truly here thenーー,

Subaru: “Am I being treated as deceased, ever since I lost my memories…… the 『Books of the Dead』 of 『Taygeta』, that Hall of Memories, is even observing the worlds I die in……?”

If that were the case, then in no way is it inconceivable that it was depicting Subaru’s 『Deaths』 in some type of form through the 『Book of the Dead』. However, in that case, what did that make of 『Return by Death』.

Subaru: “Whether it rewinds time, or does it rebuild the world itself, I had given a thought to both but……”

For the argument’s sake, in the case that the 『Books of the Dead』 assumed a method to generate the book of 『Natsuki Subaru』, it could not be helped but to reach the conviction that the latter had much more likelihood. If that holds true, then the phenomenon which encased this Natsuki Subaru was not something as charming as 『Return by Death』 butーー,

Subaru: “Am I, an idiot. No, I am an idiot…… Damn, coward.”

Sensing his contemplation disarray into a slant, Subaru abused himself.
Why his thoughts had gone astray, he understood the reason for that by immediately noticing his own cowardice. ーーHe was merely, frightened of the 『Book of the Dead』.

What would happen when he would read the book of 『Natsuki Subaru』.

He was frightened, of that happening whose course was completely unfathomable. That is why, pursuing the hypothesis lacking all foundation, he was trying to delay it and keep delaying it.
Of opening up the first page, of the book within his hands.

Subaru: “ーーーー”

Though it was not a hypothesis which came into being merely five minutes ago or anything, the fact that the 『Book of the Dead』 of 『Natsuki Subaru』 was present here was strange, but for Subaru, it was also salvation.
Subaru also considered the evidence that it had not popped up and appeared at just this instant.
However, along with that, it also held the meaning that a 『Natsuki Subaru』 other than himself, had certainly existed and had walked his own path in this different world, and also that Subaru was trampling upon those footsteps from above, laying waste to them, and painting them out.
That is why, all that was left was to gain confirmation.

Subaru: “First of all, as the 『Book of the Dead』 of 『Natsuki Subaru』…… where does this thing start from, and where does it end at?”

At Meili’s instance, precisely from her infancy onwardsーー ever since she gained awareness of ■, ever since her memories had been established as memories, even her half death was able to be followed up to.
However, how would things unfold in Subaru’s case. ーーHaving read the 『Book of the Dead』, it originated with sprouting as self-consciousness identical to that of Meili, facing growth over time, and finally, where it all came to an end.

If 『Natsuki Subaru』 is being counted as deceased instead of the present Natsuki Subaru who lost his memories, to follow up to 『Natsuki Subaru’s』 memories till the moment immediately preceding the loss of memories, would be natural, or perhaps not.

Instead, perhaps it would follow up to the memories of the present Subaru, who had lost his memories, and awakened inside the tower. In that scenario, which 『Death』 would it choose for the end.
Otherwise, as Reid’s 『Book of the Dead』, what would merely be present would be a wreckage of memories turned void.

Just as the memories of Reid, which had been recorded in the 『Book of the Dead』, had disappeared from within the book in order to reconstruct him as the trial taker of this tower, the memories of 『Natsuki Subaru』 had also possibly disappeared.
That is why, what would be visible after opening this book would not be the memories of 『Natsuki Subaru』, butーー,

Subaru: “ーーIn the end, what do you want to do, cowardly bastard.”

Does he desire to see it, does he desire not to see it.
Disdaining his own self, who had been unable to easily respond to that, reprimanding the fearfully curled up ■, he exhaled.
After coming this far, it was inconceivable to opt for not seeing it. Even if it had risen to the surface as an option, he could not even envisage the lunacy of choosing it.

That is why, that is why, that is why, that is why, that is whyーー,
And then, and then, and then, and then, and thenーー,

Subaru: “ーー~hk.”

Taking a powerful breath in, he opened up, the 『Book of the Dead』.
And, the journey of 『Natsuki Subaru』, of an unknown origin and an unknown terminationーー.
"
Chapter 74,“Natsuki Subaru”,"Short, black hair, legs with the same length as his upper body, sanpaku eyes enough to kill someone.
Those almost unpleasantly familiar features no matter which one was to be chosen, were overlooking Natsuki Subaru whilst sitting on the white, bare ground.
Subaru: “ーーーー”
Astounded, fixedly, he gazed a deep stare into the opposing person’s face.
No matter which angle he looked at it from, it was a face he was acquainted withーー no, it looked slightly different. That was perhaps because it was, in a true sense, not the form he was accustomed to seeing.
That which he had grown accustomed to looking at ordinarily, on overwhelmingly​ multiple occasions, was something reflected upon mirrors or the surface of water. Strictly speaking, the human face was not perfectly symmetrical on both halves, that alone shaped a sensitive disparity.
That is whyーー,
???: “Ah, is that so. It’s not a mirror’s reflection so it feels a bit awkward, huh. In that sense, this is probably closer to imaging it as facing a photograph or a video recording, isn’t it.”
Subaru: “ーー~hk.”
???: “ーー? Ah, could it be, you thought of the same thing?”
When he slightly tightened his cheeks upon the single voice seemingly having read his mind, the opposing person precisely guessed those feelings as well.
Though ■ was flustered by even that, any response he could possibly give could neither serve as poison nor medicine. In the first place, what was essential for Subaru was not something on the likes of quick exchange of remarks.
Far greater, precisely that, the problem which seemingly jolted away everything wasーー,
???: “Once again then…… hey, sibling.”
Subaru: “ーーーー”
???: “No, sibling feels slightly faulty for an expression, huh. More accurately this’d be…… hey, another me.”
Raising a single hand, the personage greeted with a relaxed toneーー no, he was not a person so unduly distant. He was an existence such that even calling him someone close would be a half-hearted expression.
After all, because the one present there was unmistakably was, with the same face as Natsuki Subaru, none other than『Natsuki Subaru』.
Subaru: “ーー『Natsuki Subaru』.”
‘Subaru’: “……You know, doesn’t that have a strange ring to it? On top of that, calling yourself using the full name…… though, I don’t know using what else would be correct. Though it’s a situation often there in manga and stuff, it’s pretty troublesome in reality.”
Subaru: “『Natsuki Subaru』……!”
Discerning rage for『Subaru』, who piled up remarks as if talking about good weather, Subaru stood right up at that spot. And as he tried to grasp the opponent’s collars, his legs tangled instantly.
With no strength driven into his knees, his stance crumbledーー,
‘Subaru’: “Woops, watch out.”
Subaru: “ーー~hk, don’t touch me!”
『Subaru』, who was in front, caught his body which was pitching forward and falling. The moment he came in contact with those arms, Subaru experienced unbearable repugnance and shook off the opponent’s arms.
At the same pace, taking steps and distancing himself away from『Subaru』, he continued glaring at the opponent.
Subaru: “Why are, you here…… first of all, where is this place!?”
With『Subaru』within his field of vision, Subaru signalled the surrounding white world with his hands.
White space, a place with nothing, that was just as the cradle of Od Lagna where he had confronted that Sin Archbishop of『Gluttony』, Louis Arneb.
Subaru: “Shit……!”
It was a total mess inside of his mind.
In accordance with the real time that flowed within the tower, his meeting with Louis was not something which happened even a few hours ago.
However, for Subaru who had stockpiled multiple attempts pertaining to the five obstacles, it felt like an incident in the faraway, distant past.
Furthermore, Subaru had personally experienced the life and death of『Natsuki Subaru』more than twenty times through the『Books of the Dead』. Even if the contents of the『Books of the Dead』were something which felt short, running through life and death in less than five minutes, there had also been more than a year’s time where nothing had occurred.
He had tasted those successively, indulgently. Neither were there any guarantees regarding his recognition not getting​ disordered.
The passage of time was vague, on top of that, he had much awaited this meeting with the unanticipated opponent.
Subaru widened his eyes and waved his arms about violently,
Subaru: “Why, are you in this place!!”
‘Subaru’: “ーーIt is, the proof of you having caught up to me.”
Subaru: “ーーーー”
‘Subaru’: “You read the『Book of the Dead』, and caught up to me. Everything you were not aware of, you must have seen it in the form of personally experiencing it. My, life in a different world, alright.”
Subaru: “Huh.”
With an indifferent tone,『Subaru』responded to Subaru, who had depleted his breath and clamoured. Viewing that composed attitude, Subaru gritted his molars.
He was unable to stomach that conclusive expression, that attitude of seemingly knowing all, anything and everything.
ーーFirst of all, what did this man, making that odious face, say just now?
Subaru: “I, caught up to you?”
‘Subaru’: “That’s right. There’s not a single thing anymore, which you don’t know about me. That’s why……”
Subaru: “ーーDon’t, joke around ~hk!!”
‘Subaru’: “ーーーー”
Subaru: “I, caught up to you, you say? Stop kidding! Don’t lie! Not yet! I don’t know about that which is the most important, which is much more essential, yet!”
Roaring with his eyes open wide, Subaru seized hold of『Subaru’s』collars this time.
Upon that usage of brute strength,『Subaru』made no attempt to parry it. Pulling the opponent’s collars towards himself at the same pace, from a distance where both of their breaths entwined, he glared into those black eyes.
“ーーーー”
Within the dark eyes of the face which was the same as his, the instant he perceived the same face reflected within, nauseating self-hatred surged within his own self.
Whether he harboured that self-hatred for himself or for the『Himself』present before his eyes, was neither known to him nor did he even contemplate considering it.
Merely remaining at that extremely close distance, he glared at the opponent and unraveled his fangs.
Subaru: “Tell me! It’s pretty convenient you’re here! Tell me now! The reason you became yourself must be somewhere! I haven’t seen that. I haven’t found it. That is……”
‘Subaru’: “The reason I, became myself?”
Subaru: “That’s right! There must have been a cue for you, to turn into yourself! You are, you are……”
‘Subaru’: “ーーThat, must have been seen by you, no?”
With his collars seized,『Subaru』was gazing at Subaru, nonresistant.
He did not even try to repel away the arms waving him about. Subaru received that as a hallucination as if he wasn’t even doing anything.
He perceived exactly that, as being looked down onto from a higher levelーー,
Subaru: “Stop looking at me like that!”
‘Subaru’: “ーーGah ~hk.”
Aiming at that conclusive side profile, Subaru launched his fist.
The fist wielded firm impact, blowing『Subaru』off as if he had been strummed. There was no recoil, no similar pain striking back at Subaru.
The pain『Subaru』sustained, injured, was only the pain『Subaru』had sustained.
That was, not identical to what Natsuki Subaru had sustained.
Subaru: “Lining up words, as if knowing that…… is that so, I get it.”
Smacked by Subaru,『Subaru』had knelt down on his right leg. Observing him rubbing his struck cheek with the back of his hand, Subaru consented.
That opponent ahead of his eyes, who spoke with a mouth as if knowing everything, was not mistaken.
First of all, if this was the cradle of Od Lagnaーー the Hall of Memories, would that not make him the opponent he should be utmost vigilant of above all other matters
Subaru: “Are you, Louis? The Sin Archbishop of『Gluttony』! It’s you again, right!?”
‘Subaru’: “……Me?”
Subaru: “Don’t play dumb!”
Last time, Louis, whom he had encountered in the Hall of Memories, attempted to prompt segregation between Subaru and『Natsuki Subaru』, and eat that existence away from his head through one way or another.
Back then, he had managed to escape those fangs from a hair strand’s breadth worth of distance but had their nature been such that they would be willing to give up through simply that alone, they would not be called Sin Archbishops.
Just how ugly, how irredeemable the existences known as the Sin Archbishops were, he had witnessed that in its​ entirety.
Petelgeuse, Regulus, Sirius, Capella, all of them were the absolute lowest and worst of failures as personalities. Ley, Roy, and Louis were no exceptions to that either, he could especially affirm that.
What if Louis, who had been lying in wait inside of Reid’s『Book of the Dead』, was utilising some form of method and hiding in ambush within the『Book of the Dead』of『Natsuki Subaru』.
Thus, it was plausible that she had been boldly lingering and awaiting Subaru.
Subaru: “Isn’t that true,『Gluttony』! Louis Arneb! There’s no way I can be confused by you, who can change shapes and forms, like this!”
Relying upon the『Memories』and『Names』stolen from others, rather than just the opponents’ abilities but extorting even their form, and chewing and digesting them as if they were her belongings was the Authority of Louis Arneb, as well as that of her elder brothers, Ley Batenkaitos and Roy Alphard.
She had demonstrated that artifice even within the tower, lacking any regret. Nothing felt out of place should her place of demonstrating that merely have gotten changed to the Hall of Memories.
Subaru: “This time for sure, devouring me and hijacking me, is that what your plan is? Even after being rejected once, persistent little…… do you really want to『Return by Death』so much!?”
Without any vacillation, he voiced the words『Return by Death』.
He had personally experienced the memory of having to taste hellish anguish by voicing that on several instances. The penalty of having his heart be crushingly gripped accompanied with immense pain. However, it was still alright if only his self was to be the one to experience that agony. ーーCompared to the cases where it befell over Emilia, or the surroundings.
However, the penalty was not invoked for Subaru, who had shouted whilst crushing faint horror.
『Subaru』before his eyes, did not seem to have had his heart crushingly gripped at all either. In bug a single instant he understood that『Subaru』had also been relieved at the lack of the evil influence’s ingress, seemingly having been on lookout for the same. That was, infuriating.
With the same face as his, he also bore the same thoughts as him. ーーHe thought of it as an assertion that, at maximum, he and his opponent were the same.
Subaru: “ーー~hk! Just, get it already! Is this really that amazing of a power? Is this an admirable power!? It’s just dying, and redoing. Dying and redoing…… nothing more than that. If I, who uses it, am shit then the results it brings are also shit! That’s why……”
‘Subaru’: “ーーーー”
Subaru: “That’s why, I couldn’t save anyone…… I let everyone die. Because I am weak, I make everyone, miserable. Just like how, even now, nobody will get saved……!”
ーー『Return by Death』, was nothing so adequate.
It was always far better, to not have something like this be of need. Though there had been a Witch who claimed this power to be something splendid, the utmost prime and nonpareil thing in this world, he could never hold the same opinion.
Even if an ant is made to wield artillery, it can never utilise it. Ultimately, it was unsuited to it.
He was a weak, petty, lonely child who kept crying and throwing tantrums.
What the Witches in that dream tea party had stated, was correct. He was hopeless. He was weak. He could never find it. He could never use it. Both『Gluttony』and the『Witch of Greed』, who failed to comprehend that, were damned.
Just, how many times would he have to get deceived, how many times would he have to get his hope trampled underfoot, how many times would he have to get his ■ vanquished, until he learnt.
Why, after countlessly getting deceived, countlessly having his hope trampled underfoot, countlessly having his ■ vanquished, does he still think of doing it.
『Return by Death』, displayed all of the unpleasant fragments of the world.
It displayed the absurdities, the irrationalities, the destiny enough to make one avert one’s eyes.
Yet, how comeーー,
Subaru: “ーーI love, everyone.”
Without noticing, with his head hanging down, kneeling down at that very spot, Subaru shouted as if casting a curse.
And upon the disgraceful grievance similar to weeping,『Subaru』horizontally shook his head. Whilst shaking his head horizontally, for once, at this instant, he said, converging with his words.
‘Subaru’: “ーーI love everyone. That’s why, I can’t stop.”
Subaru: “ーーーー”
Erasing the tinge of red on his struck cheek with his fingers,『Subaru』stood up in Subaru’s stead.
The same attire, the same expression, possessing the same face and name,『Natsuki Subaru』, who seemed to be decisively different from his selfーー whilst that looked at Natsuki Subaru,
‘Subaru’: “The position you were put in, to be honest, even imagining its difficulty is rough. Everything completely new, starting from level 6 having the status of initial stage without the option of going back. The complaints you voice out too, I understand all of them. Because those, are wounds I have gotten to taste time and time again.”
With immense powerlessness, with immense ignorance, it was a countenance that had gotten to taste that countless times. ーーNo, he had gotten to taste that countless times.
The defeat, the agony, the grief of『Death』which『Subaru』had to taste, Subaru was aware of it all. He had witnessed it all with these eyes. He had tasted it all, with this body and ■.
Precisely because he had tasted those, precisely because he knew that was not a lie, he could not accept 『Subaru’s』 words. He did not want, to accept them.
‘Subaru’: “Had I been strong, had I been smart, had I been more, more…… it must be frustrating.”
Subaru: “Speaking as if, you understand it……! About me, what the hell do you”
‘Subaru’: “I do know. You must also be aware of what I know. It’s a pointless quarrel, actually. For both me and you.”
Subaru: “ーー~hk.”
There was no strength in his words of objection. It had been a matter of course.
An objection repels away the opponent’s words, brushes them away suggesting lack of agreement, crushingly defeating them, making the statement that you are wrong. Such an intention was essential.
Subaru of now, did not have the ability to face『Subaru』with that.
After all, he was aware of it.
He was aware that that was no lie or deceit, but the entirety of『Natsuki Subaru』.
Subaru: “I didn’t look, at your memories or anything……”
‘Subaru’: “Hey you can’t be doing this, after looking through one’s diary as per your own convenience.”
Subaru: “I didn’t look, at your memories or anything!”
Upon hearing『Subaru’s』seemingly sullen voice, Subaru powerfully clenched his fists.
Slapped, poured with jeers, yet not bending his approach of dialogue『Subaru』gave the impression of being far more mature than Subaru. Perhaps even that, was a matter of course.
After all, the truth is『Subaru』was supposed to be an year older than Subaru.
That too, having observed rich experiences in the different world and having personally experienced『Death』on multiple occasions, on top of that, having woven many bonds and acquiring the position of his current self.
But stillーー,
Subaru: “I didn’t look, at your memories or anything…… ~hk.”
Once again, once again Subaru utilised those words.
For once, right now『Subaru』said nothing to Subaru, who stockpiled the very same repentances. Subaru, without even seeking any response, resumed as if incoherently muttering.
Subaru: “I, wanted to have hopes for you. That you were an amazing guy, and that if I got to know the “something” which was supporting your amazing nature, I would be able to do the same thing too. But still……”
But still, he ended up knowing it.
He ended up witnessing, everything.
『Natsuki Subaru』had absolutely no difference from the Natsuki Subaru present here, that he was a weak and petty man, he ended up knowing that.
In the time unknown to Subaru meeting people unknown to Subaru, running past a chronicle unknown to Subaru, having witnessed a scenery unknown to Subaru, he was merely an ordinary human who had done all that.
Subaru: “ーーBy denying you, I wanted to proclaim something plausible and fulfill it.”
However, he could not do that.
Subaru: “After all, I understand your feelings. ーーBecause you, are me.”
The world『Natsuki Subaru』had witnessed, had tasted, he had viewed it.
『Natsuki Subaru』had fallen in love with this world, with the people of this world, with Emilia and everyone else and the wounds he had accepted for them to survive, he had viewed all of that.
He had been misunderstanding. He had been misapprehending.
Since it was regarding himself, it may be appropriate to say he had conceited.
The illusion of『Natsuki Subaru』being a superhuman, had been shattered and cast aside.
Subaru: “Yeah, I get it! I got it! Why you…… why you kept standing up again and again, why you never gave up after dying again and again, is because that’s all you can do!!”
Just like Subaru,『Subaru』had also gotten slammed into walls he could do nothing about on innumerable instances.
Upon each occasion of that, he died recurrently, repeatedly, stockpiling『Deaths』, amending the way he met, amending the way he connected,『Subaru』overcame hindrances.
That was all.
Subaru: “Can there be someone who won’t stand up despite Rem telling him so much to do so!? Acting conceitedly after getting knocked by Otto, I noticed that! I always knew that dad and mom, were considerate like that! I mean, they are my dad and mom, after all!”
The scenery『Natsuki Subaru』passed through, the cue essential for surmounting, not the “something” which Subaru sought but merely accumulated wishes were certainly there.
Subaru: “I love Emilia. I want her to rely on me to protect her. I want to be with her. The reason I wanted to be a knight, was so that she thought of me that way. I was happy. I want to walk outside with her without any failures, she, who is afraid of getting hated, and I want to boast around that she is someone capable of being loved by everyone! I finally had Beatrice accompany me. I want to make her happy as much as the time she had been in pain. She, has the right to be happy!”
That is whyーー,
Subaru: “ーーThe reason why you don’t give up, is just because you love everyone! Bloody bastard! Why aren’t you a superhuman! Why, are you still an idiotic brat!!”
‘Subaru’: “ーーーー”
Subaru: “Be strong like Reinhardt! Be someone who can do anything like Julius! If you can’t do that then be useful like Ferris! How about exceeding in a single thing like Wilhelm-san!? Choose even one, for you to……”
By taking time and even experiencing agony, what he realised was merely that.
That『Natsuki Subaru』was an ordinary human, that he possessed only the cards which were the same as what Subaru did, that he extremely lacked skill in properly utilising them, that neither did he have good fortune when it came to victory and defeat.
Even, a single one of just thoseーー,
Subaru: “Any single one of them……”
With a powerless voice, having forfeited all spirit, he whispered.
Any single one of them, even a single one of them, grasping tightly the hand incapable of wielding anything.
Subaru: “……You, are Louis, aren’t you.”
With a husky voice, he uttered a query unrelated to what he had said till now.
Listening to that,『Subaru』, who had remained silent for long nodded, saying “Ah”.
‘Subaru’: “No. I’m not Louis. Unfortunately, I won’t​ say even that. I’d rather not have her disturbing. You don’t need an explanation for her personality being the worst, do you?”
Subaru: “Yeah…… I guess, so.”
Responding with a meagre, feeble voice, Subaru hid his own face with his arms.
Concealing that his throat had shrivelled up due to his howling up until the previous moment, oozily, pain started to well up in his fist which had hit『Subaru』.
If this was the Hall of Memories, then Subaru’s body could not be stated to be a real entity here, is how it was supposed to be, and yet, it was absurd that he could feel pain.
ーーYes, pain,『Death』, was ever absurd and ever difficult to bear.
That was accurately why, the Sin Archbishop of『Gluttony』, Louis Arneb was mistaken.
The thought of wishing​ for that by one’s own accord, was unmistakably mistaken.
Subaru: “……Why did you, disappear.”
‘Subaru’: “Hm?”
Subaru: “Why did you vanish away. You disappeared, that caused, so many hardships……”
The impetus of the ever present incomprehension, and the origin of everything.
The reason why『Natsuki Subaru』disappeared, and Natsuki Subaru was born.
Just what happened to the body of『Natsuki Subaru』, who had disappeared alongside his memories.
Subaru: “The reason why you disappeared……”
‘Subaru’: “……That was a total miss on my part. I entered『Taygeta』with the intention of finding a way to capture Reid. Then, through the series of events, it was all great till I found Reid’s book, but……”
Subaru: “……Then, Reid’s book turned out to be empty.”
‘Subaru’: “Then I was put in the same bowl as『Gluttony』. The rest is, you probably get it even without me having to say it.”
Scratching his head,『Subaru』looked back onto his own shame.
Encountering Louis Arneb in the Hall of Memories,『Natsuki Subaru』had gotten『Memories』stolen. And, forgetting all of his life in the different world until that point, his self, of course, created Natsuki Subaru who could not apprehend the feelings of the people around him.
‘Subaru’: “Don’t depreciate yourself like that…… Would be difficult even if I tell you so, huh. After all, you are me.”
Subaru: “……『Natsuki Subaru』is a weak, petty, irredeemable huge idiot.”
‘Subaru’: “That’s not wrong.”
Subaru: “But.”
‘Subaru’: “ーー?”
Whilst making a wry smile and gesturing his agreement,『Subaru』raised his eyebrows in response to Subaru, who had whispered powerlessly.
While looking at that『Subaru』, Subaru voiced the continuance of the words he had held back.
That wasーー,
Subaru: “ーーYou are, an amazing guy,『Natsuki Subaru』.”
ーーThat was, his honest opinion lacking all exaggeration, having witnessed him『Return by Death』greater than twenty times.

Chapter 76,“The Hell Bearing the Name of Oneself”,"“ーーーー”
ーーWith the young girl who had experienced『Return by Death』and was sobbing with her hands on her head before his eyes, Natsuki Subaru intently stared at his own palm.
It was not as if he was feeling hurt after having been called a monster, after having been spoken ill of.
That he was crazy. That it was impossible to withstand, he agreed with those notions as well.
Subaru himself, had died countless times until now.
He was aware of something as basic as those experiences being unordinary. But he had simply gritted his teeth, and endured it.
Believing with all his heart that it would be better for him to suffer than the death of someone aside from himself, a friend or an acquaintance, people whose names and faces he did not know, his precious comrades or the people he loved.
That wasーー,
Subaru: “ーーYeah, I sure am amazing, right, Natsuki Subaru.”
Tightly clenching the fist he had been gazing, Subaru『Sang His Own Praises』from the bottom of his heart.
He had been commended, through loose-lipped logic impossible to be held true. Such words had been used as if to console oneself, or for encouraging oneself.
However, the『Singing His Own Praises』just now had been different.
The『Memories』and『Real Experience』which had observed the existence named Natsuki Subaru terribly objectively, were commending the path oneself had walked until now.
Subaru: “Dang. I’m unexpectedly a pretty big deal, huh.”
And that was something which『Natsuki Subaru』, who had lost his『Memories』and had returned to the starting point of being summoned into the different world, and ultimately reached this point after taking a deep read of the『Books of the Dead』, could also be told.
Starting from being ignorant with regards to the different world, accumulating personal experiences of『Death』sufficient to equal the single year Subaru had lived through, and had returned without letting his heart shatter into pieces, impressively.
Thanks to that, the lost『Memories』and the『Memories』thereafter had been unified.
Subaru: “Meili, Shaula, entrusted to me, and I will take responsibility for them.”
Meili, for whom murder had become a habit, and had locked herself into a dark future.
Shaula, who had been liberated from a vain wait which lasted for four hundred years, and wished to continue the blessed present.
Subaru: “Ram and Julius, both of them sure act unreasonably. For those two to be doing that, that’s quite a feat.”
Ram, who already knew the best possible option, and displayed prudence more reliable than anyone.
Julius, who had lost his own resort, yet embraced faith and still resumed holding the sword.
Subaru: “Beatrice and Echidna, I’ve really been a bother to them as well. Geez, I’m such a……”
Beatrice, who dedicatedly supported Subaru, and noticed the limits of his heart before anyone else.
Echidna, who was utmost suspicious regarding Subaru’s amnesia, and had granted him forgiveness at its extremity.
“ーーーー”
And, no matter if he lost his『Memories』, no matter how many times he redid, he ultimately returned to the path of being drawn towards you.
He wanted to do that. He must do that. He could not think of any other path.
That is how much, you areーー,
Subaru: “ーーEMT.”
With love and certain tranquility on his lips, Subaru raised his face.
And looked at Louis, who still had her face covered and was shivering.
Subaru: “Hey.”
Louis: “Eek ~hk!”
Subaru: “……You’re too scared.”
Subaru scratched his cheek with a single finger upon her being excessively frightened by a single call.
She was a young girl with an outward appearance which could unobjectionably be called young. The form of that young girl shivering in fear, desperately rejecting the world was a sight heavy to the chest. It seemed she had been endowed with something akin to fleeting fragility which would make one thoughtlessly extend a hand to her, by birth.
Surely, an attainment of the nature to undo the opponent’s vigilance and crawling into their interior. ーーThat could perhaps be, a crystal pure like a child that had been coercively refined.
That Louis Arneb, who did not know of the world, was like an innocent, pure child.
Howeverーー,
Subaru: “ーーLouis Arneb, you lose.”
ーーNatsuki Subaru shall not forgive Louis Arneb, who was sobbing like a child.
“ーーーー”
Louis widened her eyes, frozen, upon the verification of defeat that had been slammed right before her.
Whilst witnessing fear fill her eyes like ink spilled on a white sheet, Subaru’s heart yet remained peaceful like the calm at sea.
The world was not filled with problems that could be ignored simply because of not knowing. And the deeds Louis or her siblings had committed were countless inhuman and demonic atrocities.
It was not as if she did not get a chance to know. Through the『Memories』of others, she must have also had a chance to come in contact with human emotions, likes and dislikes and learn from them.
However, what she absorbed from there was not something akin to affection for others, but a further dusky, grisly desire, and the conduct of trampling upon and spitting on the effortful lives of others.
Perhaps the fault was that of her teachers. Her elder brothers, had been bad role models of her life.
However, it was her decision to never use any chance to return back from the mistaken path.
Subaru: “You may know as well if you were a part of me. But the ranks which you all…… Sin Archbishops name yourself as is common with the seven deadly sins. “Seven deadly sins” is a pretty english term for chuunibyou purveyors, but there also exist the “Seven heavenly virtues” which are something close it.”
The seven deadly sins,『Pride』『Envy』『Wrath』『Gluttony』『Sloth』『Lust』『Greed』.
And the seven heavenly virtues,『Chastity』『Humility』『Temperance』『Patience』『Diligence』『Charity』『Kindness』.
If the seven deadly sins were karma impossible to be sundered from humans as long as they live, then these were seven conventions which mustn’t be forgotten in order for humans carrying the burden of those sins to live with others.
Because they respect that, humans can live with other humans.
Subaru: “But, you all…… you, violated that.”
That is why, the Sin Archbishops, Louis Arneb had become an unforgivable great evil.
Louis: “Eek, eek, eek……”
The frightened, curled up Louis was struck with Subaru’s words and was shivering as if she had experienced agony.
The slightest effort of others, of the world connected to fear. Subaru was also aware of that sensation.
Having tasted the other-worldly sensation called『Return by Death』, in a situation of not knowing how to surmount the obstacle however much one may『Die』, even the sound of dry leaves swaying in the breeze seemed fatal to life.
Because he remembered that feeling akin to the soul being frozen, Subaru closed his eyes.
And,
Subaru: “Louis Arneb, you lose.”
“ーーーー”
Subaru: “So, recognise that and release anything and everything.”
Once again, Subaru repeated her defeat such that she could hear it herself. On top of that, he pushed a firm demand toward the young girl, who remained silent upon hearing that.
The return of Subaru’s own『Memories』was due to the chance meeting between Natsuki Subaru, who lost his memories, and Natsuki Subaru of the moment immediately previous to his memories being robbedーー since his advance through the different world was replayed in the『Books of the Dead』, he was able to restore his own memories in the from of tracing them back.
In the form of re-experiencing the stolen『Memories』by utilising the『Books of the Dead』.
And fulfilling the unification of Subaru before and after losing『Memories』, the result was the successful second advent of Natsuki Subaru.
As it’s byproduct, Louis, who had gotten into Subaru in the form of a Witch Factor, had been forced out as a foreign substance. However Subaru had witnessed with his own eyes, her self-indulgent treatment of the stolen『Memories』of freely bringing them out and peeling them off.
If that was possible then a method to save the people who had their『Memories』, their『Names』robbed would beーー,
Subaru: “If we think of doing it, then we can do anything is what you said, right. Then……”
From being conceited and bragging about her own abilities, she had even succeeded in a stunt like splitting the Witch Factor into two.
Since she had achieved that, then surely it wasn’t impossible for her to cancel out the effects of her own Authority. If that, that alone, could come true, then perhapsーー,
ーーIt would be possible to recover the people who got their『Memories』and『Name』stolen, to recover Rem.
Subaru: “Then, release all of the people you’ve eaten up until now. If you do that……”
Louis: “……Do that, then what?”
“ーーーー”
Subaru articulated powerfully, but Louis shortly intercepted that voice.
Louis remained on white floor in the posture of pulling her knees towards herself, making her long, long golden hair spreading out on the floor blanket herself, she was glaring at Subaru through the gaps of her hair.
What dwelled in her eyes, was the sole unquestionable hue of fear.
Louis: “Do that, then what?”
Repeating, Louis piled up the same question yet again.
Subaru had been caught off guard by her retort for a moment, but got a hold of himself immediately after she displayed her stance of conversation. Far better than her not talking due to fear.
He must accept the words head-on and fumble around for a compromise plan that could change the situation.
Subaru: “Release the great number of people, you have eaten. If the『Names』return, then even the honour of the people who’ve already died can be restored. The people who are alive, can even reunite with their families. If you would do that, then I will let you……”
Louis: “ーーOff the hook, you say? If we do that, then onii-san will let us off the hook? Off the hook, you say?”
His words intercepted yet again, Subaru felt daunted.
Viewing that reaction of Subaru’s, Louis said “Hah” and opened her mouth bearing sharp fangs,
Louis: “That can’t be, isn’t it! That isn’t possible!”
Energetically lifting her face, Louis shouted with a blazing glint in her eyes.
Her two eyes glaring at Subaru, they immutably remained soaked in fear, twinkling darkly.
With those dark twinkles in her eyes, Louis forcefully rocked her body back and forth,
Louis: “It isn’t! It really isn’t, it isn’t after all, it indeed isn’t, we’re telling you it isn’t, as it isn’t, as we know it isn’t, that’s why! Onii-san will not let us off the hook! Absolutely certainly! After all”
“ーーーー”
Louis: “Onii-san, destroys his enemies! Absolutely crushes them until the very end of the end! Without any exception! Completely thoroughly! Closes it with a perfect game! He can do that! Then there’s no way he wouldn’t do that! There’s no point in him not doing that!”
As if having heard a first-class joke, Louis ended her silence and let her emotions explode.
And to Subaru, Louis’ outbursting form was visible as terribly distant, minute.
Louis’ facial expression was disordered, trying to laugh, trying to be angered, trying to be doleful, and baffled by the notation of fear not present in any of those, she was perplexed and was imploring.
“ーーーー”
The gateways of all of Louis’ surging emotions, all directly connected to『Fear』.
Regardless of whether they began with delight, rage or sadness. Knowing that all would ultimately lead to『Fear』, for what should she be delighted, be enraged, be saddened.
Even if she were to believe, that conclusion led to『Fear』as well.
Subaru was more than sufficiently aware of the ingrained nature of Louis’ rejection. Cursing the entirety of the world, being flung into a storm of suspicion and distrust, becoming trapped in a sensation of being forbid into the slightest movement.
That was, the hell named oneself which Natsuki Subaru had also experienced.
What pulled Subaru out of that hopeless hell, was surely because there had been someone who held his hand, and that warmth never let go of Subaru.
That was, the silver-haired young girl who had saved Subaru’s life, his heart when he had first arrived in the different world.
That was, the dressed young girl who strived to protect Subaru when he had been betrayed by anything and everything.
That was, the blue-haired young girl who gently made Subaru realise when he sought to abandon everything.
ーーThat was, the reason why Natsuki Subaru had remained without being prisoned in hell.
“ーーーー”
That foundation of heart was not possessed by Louis Arneb, who was drowned in fear before his eyes.
That is why, she did not possess the ability to conquer『Fear』. ーーShe could never think of『Return by Death』other than being a nightmarish curse of being dragged into an inescapable hell.
Though quite a clichéd expression, humans cannot live by themselves. That is why, for her to be saved, she, who was caged in『Fear』, it was necessary for someone to extend their hand to her.
Someone offering their hand, just as Subaru had been offered once.
Howeverーー,
Subaru: “ーーI will, not save you.”
ーーSubaru shall not extend his hand, to Louis Arneb.
Louis: “ーーAh.”
Subaru: “I will, not save you. Neither will I pity you.”
Louis Arneb, the Sin Archbishop of『Gluttony』, the blasphemer of『Souls』standing in the white world.
Not matter how sweet an appearance, no matter how miserable and transient an ambience, no matter how luring an attitude of craving being sheltered by adults were she to possess, Subaru shall not forgive her.
The Sin Archbishops had committed sins difficult to forgive. ーーThat was the conclusion, Natsuki Subaru had derived.
Subaru: “I’m sure no matter what I say, it’ll never prove to be salvation for you in the first place.”
Louis: “Eek.”
Louis’ distended eyes were filled with naught but terror toward Subaru.
In this place though only Subaru could understand the fear she bore, the very reason for her fear was Subaru himself. In other words, her labyrinth couldn’t possibly be opened up.
And upon Subaru’s head-on declaration that we won’t save her, that he detested her, Louis stabbed her claws into the shapeless white world and whilst desperately distancing herself away from Subaruーー,
Louis: “We know…… we know onii-san’s ploy! We had been onii-san after all! That’s why, we know what onii-san is going to do…… however, we won’t let you ~tsu!”
Subaru: “You……”
Louis: “Return what was eaten! Absolutely never! After all, this is our lifeline! If we lose this, then onii-san will be able to kill us! As long as this isn’t returned, onii-san won’t kill us! Its the other way around, the other way around, completely the other way around! In order to not be killed by onii-san, we, cannot return this! That’s why you kno~w!!”
Howling with a loud voice, Louis turned her palm towards Subaru. Its not as if something was being fired from the fair palm held out. However, Louis’ aim materialised in a different form.
Subaru’s field of vision steadily distorted into white, a change was yielded in the『Hall of Memories』. It commenced constricting the world, having detected the presence of a foreign substance and seeking to eliminate it.
As a result, Subaru’s existence was extracted outーー,
Louis: “Enough, we don’t want to be in the same place as onii-san for even a second! Impossible in terms of physiology! Impossible in terms of life! Impossible in terms of destiny you see! That’s why, disappear! The ones who will eat onii-san, will be onii-chan and nii-sama! Either of them can do however they please! No thanks from our side!”
Louis’ decision, infuriatingly enough, was the best possible option for her.
Banishing Subaru from the『Hall of Memories』and sending him back to reality. And entrusting opposing him to her siblings Ley and Roy instead of herself.
If the Sin Archbishops of『Gluttony』could choose to share or not to share a meal, then Louis would be able to part ways from the worst platter named Natsuki Subaru. Whether her siblings would bear the same anguish as herself or not, that itself was something her current self did not know.
Subaru: “ーーGh.”
It was difficult to hold out.
With not a single thing to latch onto, and with even the ground to stand firm on becoming vague, Subaru was hopelessly the weaker side in this『Hall of Memories』.
Subaru: “If you, don’t like me doing it…… then if you settle this, by yourself……”
Louis: “We won’t go along with that ~tsu! Even if you try to make us kill you, it’s futile! You intend to take us to task through『Return by Death』! We won’t let you! Onii-chan and nii-sama, will utterly eat away onii-san! That is, the condition for our victory ~tsu!!”
Unraveling her fangs, Louis scowled at Subaru who tried to hold his ground. He could no longer oppose her will. Comprehending that, he let in a deep inhale.
Afterwards, Subaru’s black eyes directly pierced through Louisーー,
Louis: “ーーEek.”
Subaru: “If your siblings, are your final rope to rely on, then I understand. ーーI will slash that rope and make you pay. You’d better remember this, Louis Arneb.”
With a single finger pointed towards the frightened, cowering Louis, he resumed.
Subaru: “Everything distressful, everything painful, bear all of it by yourself. ーーDon’t run away, from the『Memories』.”
Humiliation and repentance, were all『Memories』necessary to shape the current oneself.
It’s entirety had become food for the human named Natsuki Subaru, and the Natsuki Subaru constructed by its entirety had reached this point after having stockpiled many a『Death』.
If Natsuki Subaru was amazing, then that was because humiliation and repentance let him be so.
Subaru: “With that being said, I don’t really want even a part of that shame.”
That was what Subaru whispered whilst being expelled out from a space to its edge, which wasn’t present in the world, with his field of vision turning white as if nothing had been there.
And, the『Hall of Memories』came untiedーー,



"
Chapter 77,“The Beacon of Counterattack”,"
Abiding by his warm emotions, dashing with the entirety of his might, he stepped foot into that place.
Opposite to his heart sending out hot-blooded pulses within the depths of his chest, the outside air had become chilly enough to whiten his exhales, and within this glaciated world, he discovered the back he was looking for.
“ーーーー”
His gaze plunged towards the slim, supple back, and his heart voluntarily came on the verge of bursting.
Though affection lighted his chest, he narrowly managed to suppress his impulse. This was no time for him to let his heart explode and die.
Powerfully gnashing his molars, he looked at the face of the enemy opposing on the other side of the struggling back.
Long hair of a dark brown hue, and a crude outfit as though being wreathed in rags. What was the most impressive, outstanding of all, was the revolting glint in eyes that trampled upon the lives of others, and had turned them into literal food articlesーー,
Subaru: “ーーLey Batenkaitos!!”
Roaring at the absolute top of his voice, he asserted his existence, and attracted the attention of the opponent.
Even gaining his attention for this singular moment alone, was beneficial. Of course, there lay the possibility of his side sustaining equal blows, but it was nothing if it meant reducing the damage being inflicted upon her.
With affection filling his heart as fuel, he could even fly in the sky right now.
???: “If that could increase our chances of winning, even slightly.”
Halting his feet before the frozen floor, he poured strength into his abdomen and glared at Ley. He maintained a watch at his movements with all of strength, and no matter what move should he makeーー,
???: “Ah……”
Such preparedness of Subaru’s was robbed and shattered by the amethyst eyes that suddenly turned backwards.
“ーーーー”
His black eyes and her amethyst eyes intermingled with each other.
The wave of emotions that appeared in her eyes at that instant was enormous, almost washing him away. Her eyes had always, always, gripped his heart and sought to drown it within themselves.
Because he wished to somehow save the entirety of the multiple emotions levitating in her eyes.
Thusーー,
???: “It’s dangerous so wait! Um, you may not, know about me, but he is the enemy! Leave this place to me! Even though you may not, know about me!”
His eyes twinkled upon seeing her call for vigilance whilst swaying her hands in panic.
Delayed by a beat, he gulped down the meaning behind her words. ーーThe『Memories』of being told this very same thing were certainly present within him. At the same time, he comprehended the turn of events.
And, he truly thought. ーーThat he was glad to have been the first one to reach this place.
He knew what he ought to say, how he ought to call out to her.
Furthermore, the thought of how he wanted to call out to her arose.
Subaru: “ーーIt’s alright, Emilia-tan.”
Sorry for causing problems for you, for making you worry, for making you wait.
Wielding those sentiments, though unbefitting for this place, he nodded whilst loosening his lips. And whilst looking at the young girl, whose eyes grasped comprehension by the few words he had said, he resumed.
With a finger of his right hand pointing towards the heavens, he posed with one hand on his waist.
Though there was no need for him to be doing this, doing this enabled him to solidify his resolve. For that purposeーー,
Subaru: “ーーMy name is Natsuki Subaru. Emilia-tan’s one and only knight!”
Emilia: “Subaruーー ~hk!!”
Subaru: “Bah!?”
The instant he declared so with a determined, smiling expression, the silver haired young girlーー Emilia dashed towards Subaru with fearsome velocity.
Colliding, Subaru was thrown backwards but he somehow supported Emilia’s frame. No need for concern, she was light as an angel’s feather. No problem at all.
But if there were to be something labelled a problemーー,
Subaru: “E-Emilia-tan!? This is so sudden I’m freaking surprised, and you’re also super light and smell so nice! Did you change your shampoo!?”
Emilia: “Stupid Subaru! Geez, you’re rea~lly so stupid! I was so, so worried! Yet just like that…… stupid! Stupid stupid!”
Subaru: “Wow you’re really calling me stupid an astounding number of times! Well, I can’t make any excuses……”
Subaru was overwhelmed as Emilia pressed him with widened eyes within his arms. Since he was meanwhile also glued together with Emilia, Subaru’s heart was a total mess and even his vocabulary crumbled.
Putting all this aside, Subaru reluctantly parted, grasped Emilia’s slender shoulders and distanced her body.
Subaru: “I’m sorry for making you worry. But, I’ve returned……. I’ve been revived? Restored? Or should I say, I’ve become the complete Natsuki Subaru, either way, it’s alright, so.”
Emilia: “Ah……”
Subaru: “I’ll leave all of Natsuki Subaru in the past. ーーThis is Natsuki Subaru’s explosive birth.” [1]
Energetically talking on and on, he forcefully attempted to exert Emilia’s relief. However, in the midst of this plan of Subaru’s, Emilia blinked and lay a single finger on his chest.
A ticklish, gentle sensation. Subaru involuntarily shivered.
Emilia: “Did you, properly become one?”
“ーーーー”
Emilia: “Because, even the Subaru who didn’t have memories, was Subaru. So, even if Subaru remembers everything now, that Subaru, who worked his hardest and put his life on the line even for the short while he was here for, was……”
Subaru: “ーーYeah, hm. It’s alright.”
Whilst touching his chest, Emilia affirmed Subaru’s footsteps with faltering words.
There existed a Natsuki Subaru who, due to the unification of『Memories』, could be interpreted as having become one or even having disappeared, and a time wherein their hearts were touched by him also existed within them.
‘ーーYeah, thus, it was simple.’
Subaru: “The fact that『I』was within myself, and within Emilia-tan, certainly remains even now. So, it really is alright, Emilia-tan.”
Emilia: “……Hm.”
Subaru: “So please expect great things here onward from Perfect Natsuki Subaru. With all the frustration piled up in this time of turmoil as the trigger, let’s & go towards a bright future!”
Emilia: “Sorry, I have no clue what you’re saying.”
Emilia shook her head and responded, as Subaru smiled with a single finger upraised.
This unkind attitude of her’s was also so lovable and something he eagerly looked forward to, Subaru would prefer to spend countless minutes, countless hours, countless days just messing around with Emilia like this, butーー,
???: “ーーAbout time you kno~w, had enough of your moving conversation?”
Saying so, raising his voice and calling out to the timidly touching Subaru and Emilia, was the Sin Archbishop of『Gluttony』with a devious, malicious, vicious smile.
But Subaru raised his eyebrows, in response to the fact that he did not launch an attack in this interval.
Subaru: “Yeah. I didn’t think you’d wait so conscientiously. Did you become contrite?”
Ley: “Become contr”eat” you say, that would be outrageous ~tsu! It’s just that, you know, we are『Gourmet』you see~. From onii-san’s perspective that’d be what you call gourmet? A~s one who knows the delight of meals, wanting to be pro~perly attentive to the setting of the table is what it’s about. If the table is untidy then it’s a kill-joy. Isn’t that right?”
Speaking of table manners difficult to apply practically, Ley laughed with a shrill voice in a strange and frivolous manner. Whilst listening to the ear-hurting voice of his laughter, Subaru gave a deep nod.
And,
Subaru: “I see, makes sense. I completely thought……”
Ley: “Completely thought?”
Subaru: “That you got all afraid, considering how ugly of a shape your little sister was left in.”
Ley: “ーー~tsu.”
The next instant, Ley’s expression completely changed from that of having a smile of leisure.
His smile disappeared in an instant, what appeared instead was scorching rage. Abiding by that intense fury, Ley’s body kicked the frozen aisle and plunged ahead in the blink of an eye.
Ley: “What would ‘you’, know about our Louisーー ~tsu!!”
Subaru: “I know nothing. I just arbitrarily had my body be entered by her. I have no idea what she was thinking, nor do I want to know.”
Seemingly truly possessing sentiments and love for his younger sister, enraged Ley’s dagger inched closer towards Subaru. However, Subaru did not fear the approaching footsteps of『Death』.
Controlled by violent emotion, if Ley was not viewing anything but Subaru then that was precisely what he was aiming forーー,
Emilia: “ーーI’m also here, don’t, forget!”
Ley: “Gah, bgh ~tsu.”
Accompanied by a brave voice, Emilia’s beautiful, long legs drew an arc. Energetically rotating it to a large degree, she intercepted Ley’s face as he plunged straight ahead.
The instant of the direct hit, Emilia’s ice battle technique『Ice Brand Arts』activated and reinforced her toes, which were striking the enemy, with boots of ice as bonus.
Emilia: “U, riya~a~a~a~!”
Pouring strength into her fair leg, Emilia completely swung the leg which had struck the enemy’s frontal teeth. Despite somehow defending against direct damage, Ley’s petite stature was unable to withstand that force and was pushed away, as he slid on the frozen floor and landed towards the interior of the aisle.
Emilia subsequently pointed her palm towards that direction, and the generated stumps of ice mercilessly pursued Louis’ elder brother, having collapsed, icicle dust then engulfed the aisle, seemingly succeeding in inflicting enormous damage onto『Gluttony』.
Subaru: “That did it! This was a mixed attack of my instigation and Emilia-tan’s adorable intent to kill!”
Emilia: “Is that supposed to be a compliment?”
Subaru: “It is a compliment indeed! The best! So cute! I wanna marry you!”
Emilia: “Marr…… geez, no messing around.”
With her cheeks slightly red, Emilia’s reaction as she fixedly looked towards him was unexpected. He thought her refute would be more powerful, so the embarrassment rebounded onto Subaru as well.
Subaru: “No no, I’m acting way too merry since having met with Emilia-tan. All messing about comes after the problems have been solved.”
Emilia: “Subaru! I don’t know when another attack will come! So don’t let your guard down!”
Subaru: “I know! Though I’d openly welcome it if this makes for his defeat……”
Straightening out their minds at once, Subaru and Emilia turned towards breaking the deadlock of the situationーー Emilia concentrated on Ley Batenkaitos before her eyes, whilst Subaru concentrated on the problems encircling the Pleiades Watchtower.
The five obstaclesーー even after Natsuki Subaru’s identity problem had been solved, they still remained and exposed this watchtower and all of Subaru’s comrades within it to hazard.
But some conditions had changed. For example, the menace of the shadow that descended as though symbolising a time limit, swallowing the entire tower and bringing ruin to everything.
If that wasーー,
Subaru: “If that is, the penalty as the way I’ve imagined it till now……”
The event of the shadow swallowing everything, was the reappearance of the catastrophe he had formerly encountered in the『Sanctuary』as well.
The story behind why that happened was because he had spoken to Echidna within the『Graveyard』and had unburdened himself by telling her everything about『Return by Death』. If the happenings occurring in this tower were also of the same kind, then that shadow resetted everything in cases when『Return by Death』had been largely leaked outside.
In other words, it was surely because Louis Arneb had been within Subaru.
Now that Louis Arneb had been eliminated, and her existence had disappeared from Subaru’s interior, there was around a 50% chance that shadow would swallow the Pleiades Watchtower.
Hence he did not possess the option to rely on that and let the circumstances proceed slowly.
Subaru: “Emilia-tan! I have a plan!”
Emilia: “ーー! Got it! Then, let’s follow it!”
Subaru: “I haven’t said anything yet though!?”
Subaru arranged the options in his mind and accordingly called out to her, and the next instant came Emilia’s ready consent flying towards him without him having said a single word of explanation.
Subaru was surprised, as Emilia said “It’s fine!” in response,
Emilia: “Subaru’s plan must be one he came up with after thinking with all his might! I can trust it far more than having to think about a lot of things and coming up with an answer here!”
Subaru: “ーーAh, damn it! Makes me so happy you’d say that!”
Scratching his head, Subaru powerfully stomped the floor as though in response to the faith that made him feel uneasy. Afterwards, Subaru pointed towards the interior of the aisle, the space filled with icicle dust,
Subaru: “For now, Emilia-tan, another shot at him!”
Emilia: “Aye!”
With an explosive, dynamic sound, Emilia dropped the floe of ice onto the interior of the aisle.
It would be great if this merciless strike made for the finishing blow for Ley, but that would be a dim prospect. In reality, Emilia spilled out a note saying “Ah!” as she widened her eyes upon the impact,
Emilia: “Subaru! The Sin Archbishop from earlier……”
Subaru: “Tch, he’s a tenacious bastard. But there should be no way he took absolutely no damage.”
When Emilia turned backward, Subaru understood from her expression that Ley had erased his form from the course of impact.
He had gotten fed up of that tenaciousness, on the same level as that of a cockroach, but his characteristic of judging the situation to be unfavorable and ejecting accordingly was different from Petelgeuse of aggravated diligence and tactless frankness, or Regulus who did not possess the word “Humility” in his dictionary. ーーAmongst the Sin Archbishops, Ley Batenkaitos had the greatest survival instinct.
However, it was inconceivable that he would withdraw from the tower.
Subaru: “Emilia-tan! For now, we meet up with everyone else! We need to re-allot the deployments of our personnel! Everyone needs to do their best or this situation won’t be broken through!”
Emilia: “Right! But, is it okay if we let him escape like that?”
Subaru: “I’ll be honest, I would’ve preferred if the one from earlier would’ve finished him off but……”
Having retreated once, Ley would surely make the best use of this time to catch up on his breath as well. In that case, it would be difficult to calculate the necessary time and certainty for striking Ley.
Then they might as well prioritise planned movement in this situation, and take custody of his life.
Subaru: “No need to worry, he won’t leave the tower or anything. As he’s stimulated a lot because of Louis…… because of his little sister. The misunderstanding siscon bastard won’t back down.”
Emilia: “Sisskon……?”
Subaru: “It means one who is affectionate to their younger sister. Though in their case, it’d be being affectionate to the little sister in a negative sense.”
At the very least, it did not seem as though Louis deeply loved Ley or Roy, her true elder brothers, very much on her end. To devote themselves for the sake of Louis without even knowing that, they were either pitiable victims or just role-playing maniacs intoxicated with that duty.
However, ironically, only the unbending distorted ways of the Sin Archbishops could be relied on.
Subaru: “Someone who can adapt to circumstances and flexibly change methods to deal with something, wouldn’t become something like a Sin Archbishop in the first place.”
That was Subaru’s Sin Archbishop evaluation, having unwillingly repeatedly come in contact with the Sin Archbishops.
Hence, it was not easy to track down the dirtily living Ley Batenkaitos. Meanwhile, situations Subaru could not interfere with continued to head towards ruin.
Before that happenedーー,
Subaru: “Emilia-tan! We go where everyone is!”
Emilia: “Mhm, got it! But, I don’t know where everyone is……”
Subaru: “ーーIt is my duty, to SubaNavi ’em.”
Natsuki Subaru Navigation System.
ーーSubaNavi for short, referring to『Cor Leonis』, he activated.
“ーーーー”
Queer, deep emotions came to his mind upon the activation of the Authority wherein coexisted familiar and unfamiliar sensations.
Concentrating the whereabouts of his beating heart, he magnified everything within the close range of his radar with his beating heart at the centre. That was close to sonar, which grasped the surroundings based on the reverberation of sounds.
But, what he could feel was his comrades’ warmth and fleeting lights, thus it was a restrictive sensation.
ーーHowever, that which specialised solely in feeling the existence of his comrades, rather than being an omnipotent might, was presently the Authority of the most worth for Subaru.
Figuring the location of those fleeting lights, Subaru lifted his face.
Just as he had first hurriedly met up with Emilia, next, they shall prioritise meeting up with the members she had earlier enabled to run away.
In other wordsーー,
Subaru: “ーーFirst, we retrieve my cute partner!”

"
Chapter 78,“The Four Corners”,"Subaru: […Are you ready? The tower’s in pretty bad shape right now. If I were to go out and say how bad it is, it’s nearly as bad as playing Othello with all four of its corners taken away from you.]
Ram: [That… must be pretty bad.]
Ram’s expression clouded over as Subaru launched into his explanation, holding one of his fingers up in the air. Quite the solemn look had appeared on the latter’s face. Albeit, Ram wasn’t the only one who was taking this seriously. Emilia and Beatrice, who were listening in as well, were like that too.
Othello ― more commonly referred to by the name Reversi ― was a board game in which two players competed on an 8×8 = 64 board using black and white pieces.
Naturally this was knowledge Subaru had brought with him from his original world. But since it had been relatively easy to recreate the game here, he’d introduced it to the Roswaal mansion fairly early on. It brought a huge stir, with it being extremely well received, especially from Emilia.
That’s why he was able to properly convey the gravity of the current situation to them. Having all four of your corners taken away from you in Othello meant that you were already completely lost.
Furthermore, though she hadn’t partaken in it much, Ram had literally been as strong as an Oni in the few occasions she’d played, as one would expect from her.
In any case…
Beatrice: [Losing all four corners, an utterly outrageous situation, I suppose… That’s going too far, even as a handicap, in fact.]
Emilia: [I guess even I’d end up becoming as busy as a bee and winning if I got ahold of so many of them…]
Subaru: [Who even says “busy as a bee” these days…]
Emilia: […! Subaru, can you say that again?]
Subaru: [I will, but later. Later.]
Emilia snapped onto Subaru’s traditional retort, looking somewhat dejected at having her request denied. Although he felt a bit guilty seeing her like that, the flirting would have to wait until later, just like he’d said many times.
Their first priority was to find a way out of the situation they were in. And for that…
Subaru: [The four corners… They’re the two “Gluttonies” inside the tower, as well as the swarm of Witchbeasts they’ve called with them. Also, it pains me to say this, but our companion… Oh yeah, I guess it’s sorta debatable if I can call them that…]
Everyone: […?]
Subaru had been about to mention the fourth corner, but for a split second he’d faltered on what to say next.
Namely because not even he had come up with an answer that would both be simple to understand and properly describe the woman who unintentionally stood in their way as the fourth corner.
He wasn’t so distant with her to call her an acquaintance. That, and their connection wasn’t weak enough to be called bitter enemies either. But, did they share enough of a destiny such that he could call her a companion? At the very least, he could perhaps leave it at them having sort of like a clueless, but very much unsanctioned teacher and student relationship.
Still, how did Emilia and the rest of them view her?
But, as Subaru fell prey to his hesitation…
Emilia: [You said companion right? What’s happened to Shaula?]
Subaru: […]
Emilia: […? Subaru?]
Subaru: [No, it’s nothing. That’s right, I do mean Shaula.]
Subaru immediately acted like nothing was up and nodded back at Emilia. It hadn’t been just her; Beatrice and Ram also hadn’t seen anything wrong with how Emilia had recognised her.
The way they’d perceived her had been the same as Emilia, regardless of whether they had memories of the latter or not. In other words, it served as proof that they viewed Shaula as someone friendly to them.
Subaru: [Was I being an idiot…? Yeah, of course I was.]
Stumbling over the obvious was a bad habit of Natsuki Subaru. Yet, he would reflect hard on things, leveraging them so that he could give it his all; and this, was one of his strengths.
A compliment, for each time he put himself down. Ideally he would give himself a hundred for each time he did.
That much would do. Though the true ideal would be giving himself ten thousand compliments without putting himself down even once.
Subaru: [Anyways, about Shaula… Well before that, do you remember the tower rules? The ones that mustn’t be broken. They were explained before, right?]
Ram: [Yes, they were. We can’t leave without completing the Trials, we can’t break the rules of the Trials, we can’t disrespect the libraries, we can’t damage the tower… I think those were all the violations.]
Subaru: [Yeah, precisely.]
Subaru snapped his fingers at Ram after she’d readily laid them out. Then he pointed down at his feet and swung his arm around, indicating the entire tower.
Subaru: [So, with those rules… The fourth corner shows up when one of them is broken. I don’t know which one specifically, but one of them will. Then, after that…]
Ram: [She’ll bare her fangs at us, just like she said. ――How annoying.]
Ram, assuming her typical pose with her arms crossed together, batted one of her eyes shut as she imagined the worst.
Shaula’s insane combat prowess was well known to Subaru of course, considering he’d gone through many loops where she’d killed him. But other than him, the rest of them were also well aware of it after they’d been showered by sniper-fire from afar, back in the sand sea.
Beatrice: [That vapid girl is quite strong when she uses those things of hers, I suppose. Even if we’re better off than before, where we couldn’t do a thing due to being attacked from afar, it’s not going to change the fact that things are going to get grim if she turns into our enemy, in fact.]
With their arms folded, both Beatrice and Ram frowned, their brows wrinkling up.
The fact that they were so quick on the uptake was a huge help, since he could cut down the time he spent explaining. From all those sullen faces, it was only Emilia that raised her hand. Her face, which was the cutest in the whole-wide world, was still free of wrinkles,
Emilia: [But we’d be going up against Shaula, no? Can’t we somehow persuade her by talking to her? Shaula’s suuuuper attached to Subaru, so if he tried his hardest, maybe…]
Subaru: [I’d love a peaceful resolution to this, but getting Shaula to the negotiating table seems like a tall order. In regards to her being attached to me…, I guess nothing about that’s changed, in a broad sense.]
Ram: [Meaning she’s going to be primarily targeting you, Barusu. The fact that she’s got her targets narrowed down is going to be extremely useful.]
It could be perceived as her targeting the weaker members in their camp, but regardless, Subaru agreed with Ram’s thoughts.
Rather than facing a situation where they wouldn’t know who’d be targeted by the enemies indiscriminately lurking in the tower, it would be easier to come up with a plan of counterattack that involved having Subaru recklessly targeted.
So, putting the issues they were facing in a nutshell…
Beatrice: […The four corners are: the two Gluttonies, their swarm of Witchbeasts, as well as Shaula, who’ll come to attack us, I suppose.]
Subaru: [Though two of these corners are already being dealt with. All thanks to Beako taking command.]
During the time Subaru had spent cowering in the “Taygeta” Library, the smart and adorable Beatrice had taken everyone with her in turn, and got them busy dealing with the damage that had struck the tower.
She’d sent Meili to the balcony, where she could overlook the swarm of Witchbeasts. Then, as part of that, she’d also joined up with Ram and Emilia after they’d taken Rem out of the Green Room―― Unfortunately though, they’d encountered Ley en-route, which had led to them falling into this situation where Emilia’s name had been taken away from her.
Emilia: [Mhmnh, it’s okay. Subaru still remembers me, so I’m completely fine with it. Even though he often ends up forgetting about our promises, it still makes me reaaaaally happy that he remembers me properly.]
Subaru: [Nnh, what’s with stabbing me in the back all of a sudden?]
Beatrice: [It looks to me like it’s just her usual, in fact. That girl seems to know you well too, I suppose. Though not as well as I do.]
Subaru: [No need to fight over me my sweethearts.]
Subaru gave a few nods as he stroked Beatrice’s head, basking in their affection for him. Then, while still steeped in emotion, Ram called out to him with a “Barusu”,
Ram: [You said that two of the corners are being dealt with, right? I know that one of them is Meili holding back the swarm of Witchbeasts, but what about the other one?]
Subaru: […Julius.]
Subaru grabbed his chest in reply to Ram and turned his attention to the beating of his heart.
His “Cor Leonis” power was still going strong. He was naturally taking Ram’s burdens from her. Also, the whereabouts of his companions were being broadcasted to him in real-time.
From those, there was a light that definitely seemed to correspond to Julius. And the place he was at was…
Subaru: […He’s on the second floor, locked in battle with the enemy.]
Emilia: [The second floor… you can’t mean that…]
Subaru: [Yeah, I do.]
He nodded back at Emilia as she quickly turned pale, before sneaking a furtive glance up above.
He couldn’t see it firsthand, since the ceiling was in the way, but he could most definitely feel the signs of the furious fight that was taking place beyond his gaze.
――Julius Euculius and Reid Astrea’s rematch had begun.
Subaru: […]
In the end, it looked like he hadn’t been able to avoid a conclusion to it.
After Subaru had fallen to his knees earlier, unable to pick himself back up, Beatrice had taken charge of their companions. The opponent Julius had ended up waging battle with had been Reid Astrea, even under Beatrice’s command.
That naturally had been influenced by the fact Roy Alphard ― Or rather, Reid, who’d taken over the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony’s body and gained his freedom, actively sought its conclusion.
Nevertheless, Subaru had gone through many “deaths” and crossed through many possibilities whether he’d wanted to or not. And that had made him understand something.
――As annoying as it was, fate existed.
No matter what road you followed, the firm, unchangeable reality that lay there was called fate.
The fluctuations of history were so unyielding, to the point it really made you believe things were predetermined. It was almost like the results had already been determined by fate, with all the branches converging there.
That had been the outcome of all of their wills coming together to try and achieve their respective goals. However, precisely because of that, they’d become so closely entwined with each other, that they’d never come apart.
Yet, couldn’t it also be said that meant there was no hope ahead?
Considering that the conclusion between Julius Euculius and Reid Astrea was inevitable, it could only mean that…
Subaru: [Reid should have assimilated with one of the Gluttonies, his take-over should be almost done. Though we’ll let Julius settle things with Reid. We’re going to deal with the remaining three.]
Ram: [Is that really going to be okay, Barusu?]
Subaru: […? What do you mean?]
Subaru cocked his head earnestly in response to Ram’s question. But on seeing him react like that she just muttered out a brief: “Nevermind,”
Ram: [I already know how Barusu goes about things. Looks like I’m losing my edge as well. I suppose we have no choice but to rely on Barusu’s proposal.]
Subaru: [I don’t really fully get what you mean, but you do know I can tell you’re making fun of me?]
Emilia: [Huh? No, no, she’s just complimenting you. Ram’s saying that she relies on you a loooot, Subaru. Hehe, now I’m gonna need to work hard.]
Ram: […I will be having a word with you later, Emilia.]
Emilia replied back to the mortified Ram with a “Yessir”, a slightly happy trill in her voice.
Despite the situation they were in, Emilia was most likely glad, and found it refreshing that Ram wasn’t using honorifics to address her. Now that their master-servant connection was gone, the attitude she was showing Emilia was one of perhaps friends, or maybe a little sister that was always quite a handful.
Ram didn’t have the opportunity anymore to play the part of the capable big sister now that her actual little sister didn’t require much to handle. Nevertheless, she seemed that way now thanks to the bizarrely happy-go-lucky Emilia.
Subaru: [Anyways, that’s it for what’s going on in the tower. What we need to do next is sort out the best people for each place. This sorting business is where Natsuki Subaru really shines!]
Ram: [You sure are really humble…]
Subaru: [Humble or not, it’s still important work! This is what they mean when they talk about unsung heroes! This is something only I… That’s right, this is something only I can do! This is my battle… Owowowow!!]
Ram: [Just hurry up and start sorting.]
Ram slapped his face for spending too long on the preambles. Feeling the pain of the damage he’d received, Subaru looked around at all three of their faces―― as well as the earth dragon’s, and said: “Are you all ready?”
From here on out, it would be all out war, in its truest sense. It barely made any difference whether you were a human or earth dragon; and in the first place, Patrasche was typically far more useful than Subaru himself.
But if you added Super-Subaru into the mix, their possibilities would explode ten-fold, and then double.
(TL Note: The bit above seems to be a reference to the Japanese Quiz Show: Quiz Derby.)
Subaru: [One for all, all for one. All for one, one for all. We can’t win without having everyone on board. We can’t have even one of us missing. We will start winning if we’ve got everyone, because we…]
(TL Note: Subaru says the first sentence which I italicised in Engrish before repeating the Japanese equivalent.)
Emilia: […Because we came to this tower to get back what was taken from us, we won’t allow ourselves to lose them.]
Subaru: [Exactly.]
Subaru gave Emilia a nod with a snap of his fingers before regaining his composure.
Subaru: [So, first things first, Ley Batenkaitos’ opponent shall be…]
"
Chapter 79,“READY STEADY GO”,
Chapter 80,“Death of the Mind”,"ーーIt was the scent of rage.
Fragrant, rich, it was the scent of highly pure rage. Prodigiously churning this slender, petite body, he understood that it would uplift it to greater heights.
Ley: “Haha~ ~tsu!”
Facing each other from the upper and lower ends of the spiral staircase, Batenkaitos laughed with sadness and gloom upon Ram’s caustic remark.
The young girl with potent emotions conceived in her light crimson eyes, breathing in the resentment and hatred she directed towards him, Batenkaitos tasted ecstacy.
Should he state without giving much thought to selecting the wording, saying that this one breath was what he was living for wouldn’t be an exaggeration.
Ley: “How nice, so nice, quite nice, very nice, as it’s nice, isn’t it nice. As there normally aren’t any people who’d face us with such an enraged expression, you see~. It sure is a really valuable feeling, isn’t i~t. Do you understand? We wonder if you do understa~nd, the delight which we’re feeling right now!”
Stepping on the ground upon expressing the vivifying emotion, Batenkaitos licked his lips.
Yes, this emotion and encounter, was something Batenkaitos normally couldn’t ever hope for.
The『Memories』and『Names』stolen through the Authority of『Gluttony』got disengaged from the world, and with the exception of Roy and Louis, it became impossible for anyone to even be cognizant of them.
The grief of having lost someone precious, the rage of hiestation, the hollow sense of loss, anything and everything got evanesced entirely, beyond all help.
Ley: “So naturally, that’s a matter of course. That’s why, we’ve never minded it, you see~.”
Whenever he operated as a member of the much-loathed Witch Cult, on copious occasions would he meet humans who directed their hatred towards his affiliation. However, never had there been one who knew of Ley Batenkaitos’ deeds, who harboured hatred for Ley Batenkaitos individually, who aimed to kill Ley Batenkaitos specifically.
That natural divine providence brought forth by the Authority of『Gluttony』, that obvious unwritten law, had been overruled.
ーーWith the emergence of an outsider, who did not sustain the effects of the Authority of『Gluttony』.
Ley: “Natsuki Subaru…… ~tsu!”
Whispering the name of the man Louis had been attached to, Batenkaitos attained a sweet ache in the depths of his slim chest. It was not as if he had taken influence by Louis. He had known about him, even prior to that.
He had been thinking of him, powerfully, profoundly, far earlier than even Louis.
That beingーー,
Ley: “ーーNee-sama, will also understand, ri~ght?”
The connection between the origin of this sweet ache in his chest, and the young girl looking down towards him was deep. ーーNo, not merely deep. Two hearts that beat as one, irreplaceable individuals, saying that they were the other halves of each other would be unobjectionable as well.
Thus, she would surely understand. These sweet, fleeting, far too mighty emotions. This sensation, blended with both love and hate, and the ache within the chest longing for release.
That is why, he addressed with half of his mouth open, pouring in that conviction and expectationーー,
Ram: “Ram’s already told you. ーーTo kindly die whilst baying like a pig.”
Ley: “ーー~hk!”
The subsequent instant, Ram’s first move as she flew down after kicking the staircase, made Ley jump far backwards.
He had narrowly managed to draw his body back, but the fine point of the wand being pointed out was accurately aiming for his right eye. Should he be slow in pulling back his head, it shall ransack his brain through the eyeball.
Ley: “Geez, nee-sama is mercile~ss! Had we eaten this one just now, forget about imitating the bay of a pig, we would’ve died unable to do anything ~tsu!”
Ram: “Ram has reconsidered. If you were made to imitate something below the standard of a pig, then it’ll surely be a real affront for the pig as well.”
Flying through the spiral staircase, his landing was delayed solely due to the difference in the levels of stairs. Whilst apprising her chilling intent to kill, Ram’s furious assault waged a pursuit of fierce vigour towards Batenkaitos.
Whilst gyrating her slim figure, Ram pointed out her wand, fired a kick, drilled in a shot of the elbow. Batenkaitos dodged them entirely through the handling of his body, but things like the hit which had grazed past his ear certainly possessed the vigour that upon a single hit, would certainly lead to loss of faculty of that part of the body.
Ley: “Haha ~tsu! Scary scary! It’s scary though you kno~w!”
Batenkaitos laughed whilst using his body to evade the unhesitating strikes in pursuit of him. That wasn’t flexibility, but exaltation. ーーNo, slight flexibility as well.
Ram’s martial arts were quite something. Lacking all forgiveness, she possessed no faltering in her aim to kill. Yet, Batenkaitos dodged with leisure and ease. The reason for that was quite simple.
Ley: “We already pro~perly know, that nee-sama is more amazing, you see~.”
The multitude of『Memories』terminated and packed together within Batenkaitos. Within them was a passionate one which adored Ram as an elder sister, which yearned for her infinite potential.
The untiring trust and expectation towards Ram which those『Memories』were endowed with, conveyed their contrast with the Ram before his eyes, nearly to a sorrowful extent, to Batenkaitos.
To summarizeーー,
Ley: “ーーNee-sama without her horn, is nothing but a counterfeit which even Rem can substitute for, isn’t that ri~ght.”
Ram: “ーーーー”
Ley: “Ah, did you get angry? Have you gotten angry? If you want to get angry then you can get angry perfectly fine, nee-sama. Now that we think of it, we’ve never even had a proper sisterly quarrel before, you kno~w.”
Batenkaitos set forth the reminiscences as if a belonging of his own. Though Ram’s cheeks stiffened in reaction to his speech and conduct, her attacks did not slacken.
Batenkaitos admiringly thought within his innermost heart, that she was really quite pushing herself. It was famously known that Onis who lost their horns lost their bodily control, though it was unclear how much anguish it entailed. Ram had also been continually tormented due to that penalty.
It was unknown just how many times the thought of wanting to take over her pain had come to mind.
However, alongside that also came another thought. ーーThat oneself wouldn’t be able to endure the anguish she bore.
If the agony of losing the horn depended on the strength that Oni originally possessed, then Ram must have the greatest in that regard, which no other Oni in the world could share.
Thus, commendation to her onrushing form by way of her own determination, through that compelling anguish. And, gratitude to her earnest wolfing stance, with an unruffled facial expression.
With the ripening of the greatest, supreme, premier flavour, to simply whom should he express his delight for being witness to the moment the rich aroma arose, he did not know.
ーーHe hailed gratitude and admiration, toward the miracle of happening across this gourmet delicacy.
Ley: “Truly ~tsu! Nee-sama is so wonderful ~tsu!!”
A murderous dance blended with love and hate unfolded on the spiral staircase. Whilst tasting that to his heart’s content, Batenkaitos blessed Ram’s existence.
And, tilting his body, turning over, stooping down, dodging as per the『Memories』craved,
Ley: “Now with a ta da, time for a counterattaーー”
Ram: “How truly noisy.”
Surrounding Ram whilst she pointed out her wand, Batenkaitos aimed for her fair neck. His side which had gotten into her undisputable blind spot, and Ram’s line of sight entangled when she turned around.
At that single moment, feeling intimidated, Batenkaitos interrupted the strike and flew in evasion and escaped. However, the instant after wind grazed past his right cheek, he felt blood starting to drip out.
Ley: “ーー~tsu.”
Tracing his cut cheek with his hand, Batenkaitos inhaled faintly.
It was a wound he wasn’t supposed to sustain. At the very least, the『Memories』present within Batenkaitosーー if he were to abide by the existence who best knew the prodigy Ram, then there didn’t exist a future where he should’ve sustained this wound.
Yetーー,
Ram: “Though Ram told you to bay disgracefully, an unsightly opponent’s voice is also rough to hear. Ram doesn’t intend to keep you company any longer, so you’re getting killed.”
Ley: “Nee-sama, this is……”
Ram: “If you had been evaluating Ram relying on the『Memories』, then your evaluation is yet too naive.”
Looking at Batenkaitos after he stained his cheek with blood by his hand, Ram gently brushed her pink hair. With her dreadfully cold sidelong glance towards this side,
Ram: “Were you intending to bring out Ram’s true colours? If that’s the case then that is quite laughable. ーーRam’s potential is infinite. After all”
Ley: “ーーーー”
Ram: “ーーRam is, Rem’s nee-sama.”
A baseless, careless remark, the reason why it echoed with such extraordinary convincibility was because that is how the『Memories』, present within nobody but Batenkaitos, had captured the existence of their elder sister.
Recognising that reality, Batenkaitos erased his smile and distorted his cheeks in annoyance.
Boring. Uninteresting. She doesn’t get it.
Ley: “Both rage and hatred, are spices for enhancing flavours. But, if the taste of the spices is too strong, if it asserts itself too powerfully, then even that platter goes to waste. Guess nee-sama, who doesn’t cook, would be completely clueless about these customs, hu~h?”
Ram: “That’s not true. There’s nothing to hide, Ram’s special dish is steamed potatoes after all.”
The『Memories』which had vivid recollection of that resuscitated, and his stomach growled.
Intentionally ignoring that call of the sense of emptiness and hunger in his stomach, Batenkaitos casted his mood to play around aside.
Ram was still yet to demonstrate the true worth of her strength. In other words, that meant naught but that she hadn’t revealed everything even to the younger sister who was physically quite similar to her.
In other wordsーー,
Ley: “ーーNee-sama, won’t trust even her little sister, talk about the ultimate individualism, isn’t i~t.”
Ram: “……What a superficial way of understanding things. Ram doesn’t know how many human lives you have tasted, but even those people don’t come to mind. Everything aside from Rem is trifle.”
Repudiating Batenkaitos’ outlook on meals, Ram straitened her light crimson eyes.
And, whilst caressing her own slim chest,
Ram: “Kindly exert yourself as much as you can, Barusu.”
Calling out to the young boy not present here, extraordinary determination levitated across her cold expression.
Ram: “Though something like collective destiny, makes one shiver.”
